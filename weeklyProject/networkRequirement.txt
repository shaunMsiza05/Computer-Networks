*Network Requirements*
Here's a network design that incorporates all the technologies you mentioned:

*Network Overview*

A company with two main offices (Office A and Office B) and a data center wants to set up a LAN that allows employees to access internal and external resources. The network should be highly available, secure, and scalable.

*Requirements*

1. *Subnetting:*
    - Divide the network into multiple subnets for different departments (e.g., HR, Finance, IT) and servers.
    - Use a private IP address space (e.g., 172.16.0.0/16).
2. *Static Routing:*
    - Configure static routes between Office A and Office B to ensure reliable connectivity. done
    - Use a router at each office to connect to the data center. done
3. *ACLs:*
    - Restrict access to sensitive areas of the network (e.g., HR department).
    - Allow only specific protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, SMTP) to pass through the network.
4. *Email Servers (Distributed):*
    - Set up two email servers, one in Office A and one in Office B, to provide redundancy.
    - Configure email clients to use the closest email server.
5. *Web Servers (Distributed):*
    - Set up two web servers, one in the data center and one in Office A, to provide load balancing and redundancy.
    - Use a load balancer or DNS to distribute traffic between the two web servers.
6. *DNS Servers:*
    - Set up two DNS servers, one in the data center and one in Office B, to provide redundancy.
    - Configure DNS servers to resolve internal and external domain names.
7. *Proxy Servers:*
    - Set up a proxy server in the data center to cache frequently accessed websites.
    - Configure clients to use the proxy server for internet access.
8. *Telnet:*
    - Allow administrators to access network devices remotely using Telnet.
    - Restrict Telnet access to specific IP addresses or subnets.
9. *STP (Optional):*
    - If you choose to implement STP, configure it to prevent network loops and ensure network stability.
10. *LACP:*
    - Configure LACP on switches to provide link redundancy and increased bandwidth.
11. *VLANs:*
    - Divide the network into multiple VLANs for different departments and servers.
    - Use VLANs to restrict access and improve network security.

*Network Design*

Here's a possible network design:

- Office A:
    - Subnet: 172.16.1.0/24 (HR), 172.16.2.0/24 (Finance), 172.16.3.0/24 (IT)
    - Email server: 172.16.3.100
    - Web server: 172.16.3.200
    - Router: 172.16.1.1 (connected to Office B and data center)
- Office B:
    - Subnet: 172.16.4.0/24 (HR), 172.16.5.0/24 (Finance), 172.16.6.0/24 (IT)
    - Email server: 172.16.6.100
    - Router: 172.16.4.1 (connected to Office A and data center)
- Data Center:
    - Subnet: 172.16.7.0/24 (servers)
    - Web server: 172.16.7.200
    - DNS server: 172.16.7.10
    - Proxy server: 172.16.7.20

step 1 is to do calculation for the subnets of each office. you must borrow on bit for each office to create 2 subnets

so, calculation for office A
Office A's address is 192.168.1.0/24
borrow one bit. 172.16.1.0/25
new subnet mask: 255.255.255.128
num of host addresses = 2^7 = 128 - 2 = 126

Section A
subnet: 192.168.1.0
Gateway: 192.168.1.1
first host - 192.168.0.2
last host - 192.168.1.126
broadcast address - 192.168.1.127

Section B
subnet: 192.168.1.128
Gateway: 192.168.1.129
first host - 192.168.1.130
last host - 192.168.1.131
broadcast address - 192.168.1.225


so, calculation for office B
Office A's address is 192.168.4.0/16
borrow one bit. 192.168.4.0/17
new subnet mask: 255.255.255.128
num of host addresses = 2^7 = 128 - 2 = 126

Section A
subnet: 192.168.4.0
Gateway: 192.168.4.1
first host - 192.168.4.2
last host - 192.168.4.126
broadcast address - 192.168.4.127

Section B
subnet: 192.168.4.128
Gateway: 192.168.4.129
first host - 192.168.4.130
last host - 192.168.4.131
broadcast address - 192.168.4.225


This design should allow you to implement all the technologies you mentioned and provide a robust and scalable network.`

I have decided to use vlans a means to divide departments.
In each floor there are two departments which share the access switch
The company has 4 floors, the first 2 floors represent office A and the last 2 represent office B. The last floor is shared by the data centre and office B.

Done with vlans

Office A

The two departments in floor 1 are HR and IT.
- Vlan 10: HR
- Valn 20: Customer service

The two departments in floor 2 are R&D and Marketing.
- Vlan 30: R&D
- Valn 40: Marketing

Office B

The two departments in floor 1 are Finance and Sales.
- Vlan 50: Finance
- Valn 60: Sales

The two departments in floor 2 are IT and Operations.
- Vlan 70: IT
- Vlan 80: Operations



Each floor has two access switches. The access switches have 3 additional redundant links, and all the links are aggregated through LACP.
- For consistency and troubleshooting, all the eth-trunks start from fa0/2 to fa0/5

So let me do the web servers and the dns servers
Vlans are incomplete cause you have to configure them for each eth-trunk.
