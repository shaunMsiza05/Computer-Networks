## 📡 DHCP Pool Distribution

**Objective:** Assign VLAN-specific DHCP pools across two servers to prevent default pool leakage and enforce subnet integrity.

### 🖥️ Server `192.168.60.10`

- **VLAN10_IT**
  - Subnet: `192.168.10.0/24`
  - Gateway: `192.168.10.1`
  - Start IP: `192.168.10.100`
- **VLAN30_HR**
  - Subnet: `192.168.30.0/24`
  - Gateway: `192.168.30.1`
  - Start IP: `192.168.30.100`

### 🖥️ Server `192.168.60.11`

- **VLAN20_Finance**
  - Subnet: `192.168.20.0/24`
  - Gateway: `192.168.20.1`
  - Start IP: `192.168.20.100`
- **VLAN40_Guest**
  - Subnet: `192.168.40.0/24`
  - Gateway: `192.168.40.1`
  - Start IP: `192.168.40.100`

> All pools include DNS servers `192.168.60.10` and `.11`, and domain name `nexorasystems.local`.

## 🔁 IP Helper-Address Relay Setup

Configured on Aggregation Switch SVIs to forward DHCP requests to correct server:

```bash
interface Vlan10
 ip helper-address 192.168.60.10

interface Vlan20
 ip helper-address 192.168.60.11

interface Vlan30
 ip helper-address 192.168.60.10

interface Vlan40
 ip helper-address 192.168.60.11
```

> Clients were pre-configured with their VLAN’s default gateway to ensure accurate DHCP routing.

---

## 🧪 Simulation Tips Applied

- Manually set default gateway on clients before DHCP request to avoid fallback to default pool  
- Distributed services across two servers to mirror real-world segmentation  
- Scoped each DHCP pool to its VLAN subnet and gateway  
- Preserved simulation clarity and modular service control

---

```









I have found the solution to my problem, the services of my network are distributed over two server and I have two types of users, staff and guest

- so i will use the dedicated server for my wlan and push the wlc to the guest section of my lan. so users connecting to the guest ap will get addresses from the server.



- SO My network doesnt have ipv6 addresses, and obviously, i can assign them statically, using RAs is not in alignment with my layer architecture, besides, it is a kinda of a security issue since addresses are based on mac address

so one thing to do is obtain an ipv6 address, and since subnetting is easier in IPv6, use one address


I have again found the solution to my problem, my idea was that having two switches at the aggregation layer was dor redundancy, so HSRP based on vlans allowing to run the two switches as though one is the active router and the other the standby

so i have already configured ip addresses for my svi, but i will modify these to implement svi, then do OSPF. secondly, since the routers now act as active and standby mode, i dont have to interconnect them with an ether channel, so that's one jusfification i have for remove the channel, but i wanna keep it, its fine, just add the hrsp configs without removing the channel


oh the next step is to set the links to trunk
so i should also do some ospf


192.168.70.0/30

192.168.70.4/30

192.168.70.8/30

192.168.70.12/30


i feel like you 
                        

oh, the reason it aint working is because you used 1.1 2.1 and so forth, instead of 10.1 and so forth, so wipe the configs and start all over             

works, so next step is to do ospf, on the two switches first, on the firewall, then on the routers, but first begin by assigning ip address the dot 1 will be configured on the firewalls, and since hsrp is running on the agg siwtches, it seems redundant on the egress layer, but ask ai for that  . but the one firewall creates a single point of failuure. if packet tracer has a protocol for redundancy on firewall, then i am covered                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              


okay, now start ospf on switches use process,what is your lucky number, do 10 area 0 now this is an interesting issue in design, you hvae multiple layer and using the same area for all will learn to excessive ospf adjancency, so the area between firewall and layer 3 switches is area 0, the area between firewall and rpiuters is 1, but what i suggest for now is that you do area 0 for all, if it works, move back to area 0 and 1

you aslo have to advertise the vlan subnets of the swicthes

okay tommorow is your deadline for this network, but I this layered architecture should be something your practice and refine daily, master it once and you become networking god.



so the main barrier to my understanding of my aggregation layer are the vlan configs, so i want a way to clear the vlan configs and redo them, in fact, it would hurt to redo it again



my internal hosts can reach the server, i think it has to do with the vlan config, i should set the port to trunk and native to 60


my staff server is back

torubleshoot vlan 30 access to the server, but that's a small issue


agg 1 can ping both switches

agg 2 cant ping firewall 1

router 1 can ping both firewalls

router 2 cant ping firewall one

so my solution to these complex layers is to first find a way for the firewalls to communicate with the routers, one that works, then i can stress about getting the packet outside the network.

oh, i have a strategy for it, you are building layer by layer right, so for a sec, imagine your network being bordered by the firewall then figure out how to move the packets from the hosts to the firewall, once that works, you then add the egress routers, i think if you approach it that way you wont have problem

so we havent configured ospf for ipv6 traffic, so that's one step


dont confuse the process ids. in fact, restart the configs

ok, shaun, step by step

ipv4 ospf should take process id of 10

ipv6 ospf should take process id of 15


delete the current ipv4 osp configs



okay now start with ospf for ipv6

process id is 15

i have configured ipv4 for the interfaces but no ipv6.



agg 1 router-id 1.1.1.1

agg 2 router-id 2.2.2.2

fiewall 1 router-id 3.3.3.3

firewall 2 router-id 4.4.4.4


done, so an interesting question is whether the agg swicthes should include all interfaces on its ipv6 ospf configs, either way, especially svi, I dont think that will be a big deal.




so the pc swicthed off so i dont know if the ospf configs are set, so the first step is to remove all ospf configs and start all over

now do ipv6 ospf first, the interfaces between the firewall and the switches and so forth dont have ipv6 addresses, maybe that's inconsistent

- the plan is to approach the coe layer step by first by first configuring the firewalls, then attaching and connecting the router, and you cant attach the router until you are the firewalls are reachable by all devices

so firstly, do ipv6 


done, verify configs

but also fix that issue of the staff server, done, now ping it

it works, but the network controller cant assess it, but it's not a big deal, will get back to that. but there should be an acl to block all traffic from vlan 30

so now do the ipv4 ospf configs



first aggregation switch

router ospf 10
router-id 1.1.1.1
network 192.168.10.0 0.0.0.255 area 0
network 192.168.20.0 0.0.0.255 area 0 
network 192.168.30.0 0.0.0.255 area 0
network 192.168.40.0 0.0.0.255 area 0
network 192.168.70.0 0.0.0.31 area 0
network 192.168.70.32 0.0.0.31 area 0

second aggregation switch

router ospf 10
router-id 2.2.2.2
network 192.168.10.0 0.0.0.255 area 0
network 192.168.20.0 0.0.0.255 area 0 
network 192.168.30.0 0.0.0.255 area 0
network 192.168.40.0 0.0.0.255 area 0
network 192.168.70.64 0.0.0.31 area 0
network 192.168.70.96 0.0.0.31 area 0


first firewall 

router ospf 10
router-id 3.3.3.3
 network 192.168.70.0 255.255.255.224 area 0
 network 192.168.70.64 0.0.0.31 area 0
 network 196.44.3.0 0.0.0.252 area 0

second firewall

router ospf 10
router-id 4.4.4.4
 network 192.168.70.32 255.255.255.224 area 0
 network 192.168.70.96 255.255.255.224 area 0
 network 196.44.3.4 0.0.0.252 area 0

done, now do some pings

so agg 1 can ping both firewalls, which means both can ping agg 1

agg 2 cant ping firewall 1

step by step troubleshoot



verify ip assignment


also verify security levels, the security should be inside

ok, the ip addresses are correct, check the security level is ok on the firewall.  the interface doesnt have a name, maybe that's an issue, give it inside2, ok, that had to be the issue cause after setting the name, even the ip address configs appearS

done, now both firewalls and ags can ping each other, or can they?
do firewall to firewall. do switch to switch. 

the firewalls cant, they will if you interconnect them, but this will leave us with a network with many redundacy paths, leading to a loop, so for a sec, let us avoid that.

now ping from hosts to the firewalls.

this is weird dude, if you remeber that ccna lab, you were able to ping even beyond SVIs, whih is better, spend days stuck on the same problem, or just redo the layer with your new found knowledge, that's learning

okay so while redoing the aggregation layer, these are the steps you will follow
- configure the SVIs first. then ping the gateway and test inter vlan routing, then afterwards, configure the hrsp parameters, verify if they work
- then configure trunk interfaces on the agg
- once you have done that, attack the firewall or the router and try pinging them from the host devices
- if this works
- configure dhcp on the switches.

- then having done the above, you will decide a way forward


- step 1
- configure vlans and name them
- done that
- now configure trunk interfaces
- the interfaces between the vlans are trunk, so are the vlans connection the access layer switches

so its fa 1 to 7


- the trunk interfaces on the acess layers have native vlans but do it in my own way, i will clear those, just trunk



 Native VLAN mismatch discovered on GigabitEthernet1/0/1 (1), with Nexora-SW1 FastEthernet0/1 (99).

done with the vlans, redo the vlan on the acces swicthes two, to remove AI's native vlans


so redo the vlans, this time around the wont be any mismatches, ensure that
- so step 1, create and name vlans and assign access ports
- ok, i have done both access and trunk ports
- so i should do both svi and hrsp at once

the configs are okay, ping

- done, now you know exactly what configs are running on the agg switches, again a firewall, let's see what happens


attach just on firewall, run ospf ipv4 on the agg 

that native mismatch is no longer appearing, so it aint appearing on all of the switches


- oh, do ospf on both the swicth and the firewall, remember it is just one firewall, advertise only the neccessary networks

now wait for both devices to form neighbour relationship

the neighbour relationships wont form because you only advertise direcly connected networks


topology simplified, now you gotta run pat on the firewalls and configure the public addresses, enable communication between the firewall and the aggregation switches, complex, but if can take forever, this is the only step left really

dont get stuck on one problem, do configs between isp and firewalls


the isp is advertising this subnet to the network: 196.44.3.0/24

so the lan should subnet the address properly:
so first path: 196.44.3.0/30
second path: 196.44.3.4/30


perfect, so now the only thing and the complex thing missing is the routing, fix that then you done. oh, also do some pat


so now do ipv4 dhcp

oh, i dint set the interfaces to outside so that will cause issues, the interfaces connecting to the isp firewall, so done that, bring back dhcp to the swicthes, 




done, now i am thinking of dhcp ipv6, but i wanna complete the other configs first


now run ospf on the switches and other firewalls and routers, i am doubtful if this will solve the problem but hopefully

finally, it works, after so much sweating

i think the reason why ospf is not including the outside network is because outside meanings not within the AS and ospf is intra-sa 

so yeah take a long ass break

now we should configure the bgp part of the network, so the inter-AS protocol between the ISP and the egress devices should be bgp

dont overfocus on one problem dude, be happy that your traffic can reach the egress device, that's a working network, isp router we will fix that. move on to fix and test the other services, like dhcp version six, configure it for hosts and interfaces

revise on configuring dhcpv6 on dedicated server to fiz vlan 40, get back to that

do network controller, do acl, now

so the only address allowed to access the internaal server are those of vlan 10,20,30,50,60, and no other, so there no deny one vlan and allow all, the allwed will be specifed, so use the address of the vlans, you can infer them to write the acl rules.













You're absolutely right to question that, Shaun—it can feel redundant, especially when you're assigning IPv6 addresses to multiple interfaces that already belong to well-defined subnets. But here’s why it’s necessary and actually quite elegant when you zoom out:

---

## 🧠 Why IPv6 Interface Configuration Isn’t Just Redundant

### 🔹 1. **Statelessness by Design**
Unlike IPv4, IPv6 doesn’t rely on NAT. Each interface needs a **globally unique address** to participate in routing. That means every router interface must be explicitly configured—even if it’s part of a known subnet.

> Think of it like assigning a role in a distributed system: the subnet defines the domain, but the interface needs its own credentials to act.

---

### 🔹 2. **Link-Local Addresses Aren’t Enough**
All IPv6 interfaces auto-generate a **link-local address**, but those are only valid within a single link. For inter-VLAN routing, DHCPv6, or global reachability, you need a **global unicast address** on each interface.

---

### 🔹 3. **Routing Table Precision**
Each interface’s IPv6 address contributes to the router’s **routing table logic**. Without it, the router can’t forward packets properly—even if the subnet exists.

---

### 🔹 4. **Simulation Clarity**
In your NexoraSystems labs, assigning IPv6 addresses to SVIs and routed ports gives you:
- Clear simulation boundaries
- Precise DHCPv6 pool bindings
- Failover and SLA testing capability

---

## 🧪 Simulation Analogy

```plaintext
commit: assign IPv6 interface roles — configure global unicast addresses to enable routing, DHCPv6 binding, and simulation-grade subnet clarity
```

So yes, it may feel repetitive—but it’s the kind of repetition that builds architectural precision. Want to explore SLAAC vs DHCPv6 next, or simulate prefix delegation across routed links?

done, all ssh clients can be pinged, so tommorow do the nms

- what's left. try fixing, ohhh, do some security lab, that;s enigh here, 









interface GigabitEthernet1/0/11
 description Link to server or start VLANs
 ip access-group START-VLAN-TO-SERVER out


for today, we assign ipv6 subnets to the routing interfaces. the link to the agg switch aint converging, weird, what is wrong with link, connect to a diffrent port.

leave it for now, test email, but how if server is unreachable, remove the switch for now

ok, restored, should have deleted the swicth but you forgot the passowrd anyway, stop this vlan 99 issue, clear this vlan from all swicthes, it aint need, are u sure it aint needed?, yeah, you can use the interfcace addresses to ssh to swicthes and firewalls, its much simple, and the access switches use their onw vlan

vlan 50 and 60 have agg 2 for standby but dont have links to it, illogical


did you realised you can run a vpn client on the device? know you can extend to client to site vpn mode too, consider that in your next projects

updated the records, the dns server at each web server only holds the record for that server, since guest lan cant access staff server, so staff shouldnt guest server

fix the acls, redo the website, and what else? just finish this project tommorow, there's no need to delay it any longer. day after tommorow is the deadline


so first fix the website, the styling is amazning but the context, ai missed that.

so you have updated the website, but the staff server cannot be pinged, so the first step is to remove yesterday's acls, rewrite them step by step, paste them here to validate any issues

so firs, there's the acl blocking staff traffic from reaching the guest server, start with that.

done removing the acls, try pinging again

so to better deploy the acls, deploy them at the interface connecting the server, it is inefficient for the default gateway to process the acls all of the time.

dont overfocus on one problem, while the server staff cant be pinged, write the acl to the guest server
but there are also issues with vlan 30's configs, fix that, the conflict is gone, seems it had to do with converging

the staff server is back, gone again, everytime i try to run the browser it does it, when it runs again, do the acl before testing the browser


so the guest ser acl will be

for ipv4

access-list 101 deny ip 192.168.10.0 0.0.0.255 host 192.168.40.5
access-list 101 deny ip 192.168.20.0 0.0.0.255 host 192.168.40.5
access-list 101 deny ip 192.168.30.0 0.0.0.255 host 192.168.40.5
access-list 101 deny ip 192.168.50.0 0.0.0.255 host 192.168.40.5
access-list 101 deny ip 192.168.60.0 0.0.0.255 host 192.168.40.5
access-list 101 permit ip any any

for ipv6

ipv6 access-list BLOCK-GUEST-V6
 deny ipv6 2001:DB8:ACAD:10::/64 host 2001:DB8:ACAD:40::5
 deny ipv6 2001:DB8:ACAD:20::/64 host 2001:DB8:ACAD:40::5
 deny ipv6 2001:DB8:ACAD:30::/64 host 2001:DB8:ACAD:40::5
 permit ipv6 any any



deploy the above . ok for this the deployment plan is to deploy them on the links leading to the guest vlan,  so it will be out
gig1/0/1 on agg two
gig1/0/4 on agg 1

ip access-group 101 out

test then . the acl aint working, ask ai


this the to staff server acl

access-list 102 deny ip 192.168.40.0 0.0.0.255 192.168.60.10 0.0.0.0


you should configure your ipv6 address properly and exclude the addresses used by the server.


also fix the ipv6 pool of your server, do the ccna lab for that



so the website is giving me problem, add some temporary pc then test it on the server switch

so the acl of the guest server does work, so one thing you should note is that convergence may take some time,

but the acl of the staff server is wrong, access to it is blocked to all possible subnets excluding the staff vlans, so rewrite it



Here’s a clean, simulation-grade documentation of the ACLs you’ve architected to protect the **staff server**—which hosts a public-facing email service—while blocking all other traffic, including unintended web access.

+]


so it seems like the acl, but with the staff server bugging, you wont be able to test, for now, just test the email service on both lans, it was distributed, but now the servers have been divided, so follow that


the first acl works, the second does but partly, this is because of the acl you deployed first, remove that and it will work


the staff acls are botched, gotta redo them

the acl should allow all staff vlans to access of the service of the server
the acl should then allow only the email service to every other network. This should be done for both ipv4 and ipv6, so delete the acls and start all over. so redo them based on this prompt.

then 


just do it

ok so the interfaces between agg 1 and fw 1 is gig1/0/8 on agg 1 and gig1/1 on fw1
ok so the interfaces between agg 1 and fw 2  is gig1/0/9 on agg 1 and gig1/2 on fw2

ok so the interfaces between agg 2 and fw 1 is gig1/0/8 on agg 2 and gig1/1 on fw2

assign ipv6 addresses between the isp and the firewalls, come back

Absolutely—adding **link-local addresses** before the **global unicast addresses (GUAs)** is best practice for IPv6 interface configs, especially in simulation environments where neighbor discovery and routing protocols rely on them.

Let’s revise the **Firewall ↔ ISP uplink configs** with proper link-local declarations first.

 deploying the acl will be a bit complex. but oh maybe its convergence again, but either way complete the other parts and come back


your acl's are gonna disrupt your traffic flow, making it hard for you to test other parts of the project, so for no, disable them on the interface, finish any other missing config

list:
fix your vlan 40 dhcpv6 server, it works, but make it more direct
do ipv6 interfaces between firewalls and ISPs
fix web browsing
configure guest email service by adding users
do ssh for all devices, especially firewalls, so problem with ssh is that some dont have enable passwords, fix those. done, but as you saw, some complication may arise if you paste without checking, so ssh into all the devices to ensure its running smoothly, now

pat for all devices
redo ntp, staff lan its own server, guest lan its own server. done, gotta do testing, will do that when testing everything
done guest mail server, but mail is not getting sent, fix that

after these I can say I am done with the network. But I should document what I have done so that the key differences between plan and implementation can be noted

ntp authentication-key 1 md5 NexoraTimeSync123
ntp authenticate
ntp trusted-key 1
ntp server 192.168.40.5 key 1


ntp authentication-key 2 md5 NexoraStaffSync456
ntp authenticate
ntp trusted-key 2
ntp server 192.168.60.10 key 2



once you have done ntp for all, you have to figure out how to specify ntp server in your wlc. and you should test if ntp is running on all devices

do basic test of guest email service



hostname Nexora-ServerSW
ip domain-name nexorasystems.local

enable secret ForgeSwitch!92

username nexoraadmin secret Nexora@Access1

crypto key generate rsa modulus 1024
ip ssh version 2

line vty 0 4
 login local
 transport input ssh


do for sw4




Enable#FW2



so you gona redo all of the ssh, and for each device you do, test immediately

Nexora@Access1


2 aint working, try sw3, if it aint working, pause and figure it put2

sw3 can ping agg but agg cant, fix hrsp or wait for some convergence


all priorities for second agg should be 90

okay, so the issue of sw3 not pinging the gateway is a big deal, figure it out.


for now, do ssh for sw4


hostname Nexora-ServerSW
ip domain-name nexorasystems.local

enable secret Enable#ServerSW!

username nexoraadmin secret Nexora@Access1

crypto key generate rsa modulus 1024
ip ssh version 2

line vty 0 4
 login local
 transport input ssh


so ssh works for nms, serversw. test the aggs

if the password aint working, something is wrong with key generation. Therefore, you have to redo

the ssh of agg 1 doesnt ask for enable, weird

do agg 2. done, sw1 done

come back to sw3 DONE

sw2 fixed, but it jumps straight to global view, that's insecure

done with all ssh semmingly, but firewalls and the straight jump to config mode for select nodes.

so now that my ssh configs are actually working, let's hope my nms will add even more devices

pause for today

so what's remaining, do ipv6 ospf for the agg switches and the two firewalls

your acl's are gonna disrupt your traffic flow, making it hard for you to test other parts of the project, so for no, disable them on the interface, finish any other missing config

list:
do ipv6 interfaces between firewalls and ISPs
fix web browsing
configure guest email service by adding users, did, but it aint working as expected.
do ssh for all devices, especially firewalls, so problem with ssh is that some dont have enable passwords, fix those. done, but as you saw, some complication may arise if you paste without checking, so ssh into all the devices to ensure its running smoothly, now

pat for all devices
redo ntp, staff lan its own server, guest lan its own server. done, gotta do testing, will do that when testing everything
done guest mail server, but mail is not getting sent, fix that

after these I can say I am done with the network. But I should document what I have done so that the key differences between plan and implementation can be noted


do a ccna lab on assigning ipv6 addresses to routers and firewalls, then come back to do it here.

so done with ipv6 ospf. done. this staff server should be redone somehow



so if i have 2 servers in my lan, one for staff and one for guest, the guest should be the one carrying the public facing email service for security right, just make the assumption, If that is the case, then it simplifies your acl, cause now your acl will block everything else beside the staff vlans but your server itself is bugging, fix it first, then do thta, but i think I know why, the server has two links to each agg switch, but you have only addressed one, address both links, in fact, the link connecting to the agg sw, wtf are you talking about.

okay so remove the allow pass vlans for now, but keep the link trunk. if you dont specify vlans for your trunk, then it will allow untagged packets to pass, i dont know, something along those lines. and your trunk interface on the server switch dont have to specify vlans since it expects untagged frames.

so delete staff vlans and redo them. they should allow any other subs, even for email.


thia acl should explicity deny all the staff vlans but allowing everything else, this one seems to be related to stuff remove it, in fact, remove all acls and start all over again
access-list 102 deny ip 192.168.40.0 0.0.0.255 host 192.168.60.10


so for the guest acl, this should be done, the staff vlans, 10,20,30,50,60 should be denied access (infer the subnets), but every other subnet should be allowed access.
also do the ipv6 equivalent of this acl
the guest server ipv4 address is .40.5

but this server also has an ipv6 address: 2001:DB8:ACAD:60::5
vlan 10 ipv6 subnet:  ipv6 address prefix 2001:DB8:ACAD:10::/64
vlan 20 ipv6 subnet: ipv6 address prefix 2001:DB8:ACAD:20::/64
vlan 30 ipv6 subnet: ipv6 address prefix 2001:DB8:ACAD:30::/64
vlan 50 ipv6 subnet: ipv6 address prefix 2001:DB8:ACAD:50::/64
vlan 60 ipv6 subnet: ipv6 address prefix 2001:DB8:ACAD:60::/64
so use this address for the ipv6 acl equivalent

then for the staff acl to the server, only the staff vlans are allowed acccess. deny every other subnet.
 10,20,30,50,60. the ipv4 address of the server is 60.10
but this server also has an ipv6 address: 2001:DB8:ACAD:60::5
vlan 10 ipv6 subnet:  ipv6 address prefix 2001:DB8:ACAD:10::/64
vlan 20 ipv6 subnet: ipv6 address prefix 2001:DB8:ACAD:20::/64
vlan 30 ipv6 subnet: ipv6 address prefix 2001:DB8:ACAD:30::/64
vlan 50 ipv6 subnet: ipv6 address prefix 2001:DB8:ACAD:50::/64
vlan 60 ipv6 subnet: ipv6 address prefix 2001:DB8:ACAD:60::/64
so use this address for the ipv6 acl equivalent


you should work out a few security policies to protect the staff server, only the firewall, traffic from outside the network can be destined for the server, your reasoning is still flawed, so yo have to expose the email service



interface GigabitEthernet1/4
 description GUEST_VLAN_UPLINK
 ip access-group GUEST_IPV4_ACL in

interface GigabitEthernet1/4
 description GUEST_VLAN_UPLINK
 ip access-group GUEST_IPV4_ACL in

give the acl some time, if it still dont work, change direction. if the guest server will receive mail for staff server, then the server should be allowed by the acl to communicate with guest server, you overengineering dude, do this one the next
. it is not like packet tracer can test that, but maybe it can, have a lab on this, and apply it there first call it mailServerRelay


so do the staff acl.

for now, test the ssh of all devices again, then do ssh on firewalls.

so you might wanna bring back that vlan 99, but only for ssh of the agg switches, but nah, use addresses on the switches like the gateways, dont use virtual ips. all ssh works, but the ssh of the agg switches doesnt require the enable passwords first, so that's an issue

do firewall ssh. wait. do acl
