## 📡 DHCP Pool Distribution

**Objective:** Assign VLAN-specific DHCP pools across two servers to prevent default pool leakage and enforce subnet integrity.

### 🖥️ Server `192.168.60.10`

- **VLAN10_IT**
  - Subnet: `192.168.10.0/24`
  - Gateway: `192.168.10.1`
  - Start IP: `192.168.10.100`
- **VLAN30_HR**
  - Subnet: `192.168.30.0/24`
  - Gateway: `192.168.30.1`
  - Start IP: `192.168.30.100`

### 🖥️ Server `192.168.60.11`

- **VLAN20_Finance**
  - Subnet: `192.168.20.0/24`
  - Gateway: `192.168.20.1`
  - Start IP: `192.168.20.100`
- **VLAN40_Guest**
  - Subnet: `192.168.40.0/24`
  - Gateway: `192.168.40.1`
  - Start IP: `192.168.40.100`

> All pools include DNS servers `192.168.60.10` and `.11`, and domain name `nexorasystems.local`.

## 🔁 IP Helper-Address Relay Setup

Configured on Aggregation Switch SVIs to forward DHCP requests to correct server:

```bash
interface Vlan10
 ip helper-address 192.168.60.10

interface Vlan20
 ip helper-address 192.168.60.11

interface Vlan30
 ip helper-address 192.168.60.10

interface Vlan40
 ip helper-address 192.168.60.11
```

> Clients were pre-configured with their VLAN’s default gateway to ensure accurate DHCP routing.

---

## 🧪 Simulation Tips Applied

- Manually set default gateway on clients before DHCP request to avoid fallback to default pool  
- Distributed services across two servers to mirror real-world segmentation  
- Scoped each DHCP pool to its VLAN subnet and gateway  
- Preserved simulation clarity and modular service control

---

```









I have found the solution to my problem, the services of my network are distributed over two server and I have two types of users, staff and guest

- so i will use the dedicated server for my wlan and push the wlc to the guest section of my lan. so users connecting to the guest ap will get addresses from the server.



- SO My network doesnt have ipv6 addresses, and obviously, i can assign them statically, using RAs is not in alignment with my layer architecture, besides, it is a kinda of a security issue since addresses are based on mac address

so one thing to do is obtain an ipv6 address, and since subnetting is easier in IPv6, use one address


I have again found the solution to my problem, my idea was that having two switches at the aggregation layer was dor redundancy, so HSRP based on vlans allowing to run the two switches as though one is the active router and the other the standby

so i have already configured ip addresses for my svi, but i will modify these to implement svi, then do OSPF. secondly, since the routers now act as active and standby mode, i dont have to interconnect them with an ether channel, so that's one jusfification i have for remove the channel, but i wanna keep it, its fine, just add the hrsp configs without removing the channel


oh the next step is to set the links to trunk
so i should also do some ospf


192.168.70.0/30

192.168.70.4/30

192.168.70.8/30

192.168.70.12/30


i feel like you 
                        

oh, the reason it aint working is because you used 1.1 2.1 and so forth, instead of 10.1 and so forth, so wipe the configs and start all over             

works, so next step is to do ospf, on the two switches first, on the firewall, then on the routers, but first begin by assigning ip address the dot 1 will be configured on the firewalls, and since hsrp is running on the agg siwtches, it seems redundant on the egress layer, but ask ai for that  . but the one firewall creates a single point of failuure. if packet tracer has a protocol for redundancy on firewall, then i am covered                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              


okay, now start ospf on switches use process,what is your lucky number, do 10 area 0 now this is an interesting issue in design, you hvae multiple layer and using the same area for all will learn to excessive ospf adjancency, so the area between firewall and layer 3 switches is area 0, the area between firewall and rpiuters is 1, but what i suggest for now is that you do area 0 for all, if it works, move back to area 0 and 1

you aslo have to advertise the vlan subnets of the swicthes

okay tommorow is your deadline for this network, but I this layered architecture should be something your practice and refine daily, master it once and you become networking god.



so the main barrier to my understanding of my aggregation layer are the vlan configs, so i want a way to clear the vlan configs and redo them, in fact, it would hurt to redo it again



my internal hosts can reach the server, i think it has to do with the vlan config, i should set the port to trunk and native to 60


my staff server is back

torubleshoot vlan 30 access to the server, but that's a small issue


agg 1 can ping both switches

agg 2 cant ping firewall 1

router 1 can ping both firewalls

router 2 cant ping firewall one

so my solution to these complex layers is to first find a way for the firewalls to communicate with the routers, one that works, then i can stress about getting the packet outside the network.

oh, i have a strategy for it, you are building layer by layer right, so for a sec, imagine your network being bordered by the firewall then figure out how to move the packets from the hosts to the firewall, once that works, you then add the egress routers, i think if you approach it that way you wont have problem

so we havent configured ospf for ipv6 traffic, so that's one step


dont confuse the process ids. in fact, restart the configs

ok, shaun, step by step

ipv4 ospf should take process id of 10

ipv6 ospf should take process id of 15


delete the current ipv4 osp configs



okay now start with ospf for ipv6

process id is 15

i have configured ipv4 for the interfaces but no ipv6.



agg 1 router-id 1.1.1.1

agg 2 router-id 2.2.2.2

fiewall 1 router-id 3.3.3.3

firewall 2 router-id 4.4.4.4


done, so an interesting question is whether the agg swicthes should include all interfaces on its ipv6 ospf configs, either way, especially svi, I dont think that will be a big deal.




so the pc swicthed off so i dont know if the ospf configs are set, so the first step is to remove all ospf configs and start all over

now do ipv6 ospf first, the interfaces between the firewall and the switches and so forth dont have ipv6 addresses, maybe that's inconsistent

- the plan is to approach the coe layer step by first by first configuring the firewalls, then attaching and connecting the router, and you cant attach the router until you are the firewalls are reachable by all devices

so firstly, do ipv6 


done, verify configs

but also fix that issue of the staff server, done, now ping it

it works, but the network controller cant assess it, but it's not a big deal, will get back to that. but there should be an acl to block all traffic from vlan 30

so now do the ipv4 ospf configs



first aggregation switch

router ospf 10
router-id 1.1.1.1
network 192.168.10.0 0.0.0.255 area 0
network 192.168.20.0 0.0.0.255 area 0 
network 192.168.30.0 0.0.0.255 area 0
network 192.168.40.0 0.0.0.255 area 0
network 192.168.70.0 0.0.0.31 area 0
network 192.168.70.32 0.0.0.31 area 0

second aggregation switch

router ospf 10
router-id 2.2.2.2
network 192.168.10.0 0.0.0.255 area 0
network 192.168.20.0 0.0.0.255 area 0 
network 192.168.30.0 0.0.0.255 area 0
network 192.168.40.0 0.0.0.255 area 0
network 192.168.70.64 0.0.0.31 area 0
network 192.168.70.96 0.0.0.31 area 0


first firewall 

router ospf 10
router-id 3.3.3.3
 network 192.168.70.0 255.255.255.224 area 0
 network 192.168.70.64 0.0.0.31 area 0
 network 196.44.3.0 0.0.0.252 area 0

second firewall

router ospf 10
router-id 4.4.4.4
 network 192.168.70.32 255.255.255.224 area 0
 network 192.168.70.96 255.255.255.224 area 0
 network 196.44.3.4 0.0.0.252 area 0

done, now do some pings

so agg 1 can ping both firewalls, which means both can ping agg 1

agg 2 cant ping firewall 1

step by step troubleshoot



verify ip assignment


also verify security levels, the security should be inside

ok, the ip addresses are correct, check the security level is ok on the firewall.  the interface doesnt have a name, maybe that's an issue, give it inside2, ok, that had to be the issue cause after setting the name, even the ip address configs appearS

done, now both firewalls and ags can ping each other, or can they?
do firewall to firewall. do switch to switch. 

the firewalls cant, they will if you interconnect them, but this will leave us with a network with many redundacy paths, leading to a loop, so for a sec, let us avoid that.

now ping from hosts to the firewalls.

this is weird dude, if you remeber that ccna lab, you were able to ping even beyond SVIs, whih is better, spend days stuck on the same problem, or just redo the layer with your new found knowledge, that's learning

okay so while redoing the aggregation layer, these are the steps you will follow
- configure the SVIs first. then ping the gateway and test inter vlan routing, then afterwards, configure the hrsp parameters, verify if they work
- then configure trunk interfaces on the agg
- once you have done that, attack the firewall or the router and try pinging them from the host devices
- if this works
- configure dhcp on the switches.

- then having done the above, you will decide a way forward


- step 1
- configure vlans and name them
- done that
- now configure trunk interfaces
- the interfaces between the vlans are trunk, so are the vlans connection the access layer switches

so its fa 1 to 7


- the trunk interfaces on the acess layers have native vlans but do it in my own way, i will clear those, just trunk



 Native VLAN mismatch discovered on GigabitEthernet1/0/1 (1), with Nexora-SW1 FastEthernet0/1 (99).

done with the vlans, redo the vlan on the acces swicthes two, to remove AI's native vlans


so redo the vlans, this time around the wont be any mismatches, ensure that
- so step 1, create and name vlans and assign access ports
- ok, i have done both access and trunk ports
- so i should do both svi and hrsp at once

the configs are okay, ping

- done, now you know exactly what configs are running on the agg switches, again a firewall, let's see what happens


attach just on firewall, run ospf ipv4 on the agg 

that native mismatch is no longer appearing, so it aint appearing on all of the switches


- oh, do ospf on both the swicth and the firewall, remember it is just one firewall, advertise only the neccessary networks

now wait for both devices to form neighbour relationship

the neighbour relationships wont form because you only advertise direcly connected networks


topology simplified, now you gotta run pat on the firewalls and configure the public addresses, enable communication between the firewall and the aggregation switches, complex, but if can take forever, this is the only step left really

dont get stuck on one problem, do configs between isp and firewalls


the isp is advertising this subnet to the network: 196.44.3.0/24

so the lan should subnet the address properly:
so first path: 196.44.3.0/30
second path: 196.44.3.4/30


perfect, so now the only thing and the complex thing missing is the routing, fix that then you done. oh, also do some pat


so now do ipv4 dhcp

oh, i dint set the interfaces to outside so that will cause issues, the interfaces connecting to the isp firewall, so done that, bring back dhcp to the swicthes, 




done, now i am thinking of dhcp ipv6, but i wanna complete the other configs first


now run ospf on the switches and other firewalls and routers, i am doubtful if this will solve the problem but hopefully

finally, it works, after so much sweating

i think the reason why ospf is not including the outside network is because outside meanings not within the AS and ospf is intra-sa 

so yeah take a long ass break

now we should configure the bgp part of the network, so the inter-AS protocol between the ISP and the egress devices should be bgp

dont overfocus on one problem dude, be happy that your traffic can reach the egress device, that's a working network, isp router we will fix that. move on to fix and test the other services, like dhcp version six, configure it for hosts and interfaces









ipv6 unicast-routing

interface Vlan10
 ipv6 address 2001:DB8:ACAD:10::10/64

 standby 10 priority 110
 standby 10 ipv6 2001:DB8:ACAD:10::1
 standby 10 preempt

interface Vlan20

 standby 20 ipv6 2001:DB8:ACAD:20::1
 standby 20 priority 110
 standby 20 preempt

interface Vlan30
 ipv6 address 2001:DB8:ACAD:30::10/64
 standby 30 ipv6 2001:DB8:ACAD:30::1
 standby 30 priority 110
 standby 30 preempt



revise on configuring dhcpv6 on dedicated server to fiz vlan 40, get back to that

do network controller, do acl, now

so the only address allowed to access the internaal server are those of vlan 10,20,30,50,60, and no other, so there no deny one vlan and allow all, the allwed will be specifed, so use the address of the vlans, you can infer them to write the acl rules.













You're absolutely right to question that, Shaun—it can feel redundant, especially when you're assigning IPv6 addresses to multiple interfaces that already belong to well-defined subnets. But here’s why it’s necessary and actually quite elegant when you zoom out:

---

## 🧠 Why IPv6 Interface Configuration Isn’t Just Redundant

### 🔹 1. **Statelessness by Design**
Unlike IPv4, IPv6 doesn’t rely on NAT. Each interface needs a **globally unique address** to participate in routing. That means every router interface must be explicitly configured—even if it’s part of a known subnet.

> Think of it like assigning a role in a distributed system: the subnet defines the domain, but the interface needs its own credentials to act.

---

### 🔹 2. **Link-Local Addresses Aren’t Enough**
All IPv6 interfaces auto-generate a **link-local address**, but those are only valid within a single link. For inter-VLAN routing, DHCPv6, or global reachability, you need a **global unicast address** on each interface.

---

### 🔹 3. **Routing Table Precision**
Each interface’s IPv6 address contributes to the router’s **routing table logic**. Without it, the router can’t forward packets properly—even if the subnet exists.

---

### 🔹 4. **Simulation Clarity**
In your NexoraSystems labs, assigning IPv6 addresses to SVIs and routed ports gives you:
- Clear simulation boundaries
- Precise DHCPv6 pool bindings
- Failover and SLA testing capability

---

## 🧪 Simulation Analogy

```plaintext
commit: assign IPv6 interface roles — configure global unicast addresses to enable routing, DHCPv6 binding, and simulation-grade subnet clarity
```

So yes, it may feel repetitive—but it’s the kind of repetition that builds architectural precision. Want to explore SLAAC vs DHCPv6 next, or simulate prefix delegation across routed links?
