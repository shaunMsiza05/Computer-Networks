# ðŸ“˜ Project Document: Modular Pod-Based DCN Architecture in Packet Tracer

## ðŸ”– Project Title  
**Simulation-Driven Modular Pod Architecture for Data Center Networks (DCN)**

## ðŸ§­ Objective  
Design and simulate a scalable, modular Data Center Network using the **Pod model** in Cisco Packet Tracer. Each pod must support Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) configurations, branded SSH and DNS logic, and whitelist-only ACLs. The architecture should emphasize simulation clarity, security-first design, and cost-efficiency.

## ðŸ§± Pod Specifications  

Each pod is a self-contained unit with the following components:

| Component        | Description                                           |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Access Switch    | Layer 3 switch (e.g., Cisco 3560 or 9300)             |
| Server           | Generic PC or Server with branded hostname            |
| Firewall         | ASA 5505 or Packet Tracer firewall module             |
| Router (optional)| ISR router for VPC gateway or edge routing            |
| VLANs            | Minimum 2: Management and Data                        |
| ACLs             | Whitelist-only IPv4/IPv6 ACLs per VLAN                |
| SSH              | Branded SSH access with simulation credentials        |
| DNS              | Local DNS simulation with branded domain              |

### Required Capabilities per Pod:
- DHCPv6 stack (dual-switch optional)
- Simulation-grade commit messages
- Annotated configs for peer review
- VPC-ready subnet logic

## ðŸ’° Simulated Monthly Cost Model  

| Item                        | Monthly Cost |
|-----------------------------|--------------|
| Base Pod (Switch + Server) | $120         |
| Firewall Module             | $40          |
| Router (VPC Gateway)        | $60          |
| Additional VLAN             | $10/VLAN     |
| ACL Rule (per entry)        | $2           |
| SSH Branding (per device)   | $5           |
| DNS Zone (per pod)          | $8           |
| VPC Instance (per subnet)   | $25          |

## ðŸ“Œ Design Constraints  
- Total budget: **$600/month**
- Maximum: **3 pods**
- Each pod must support isolated VPC logic
- All devices must be branded and SSH-accessible
- ACLs must enforce whitelist-only access
- DNS zones must reflect simulation branding

## ðŸ§  Deliverables  
1. **Physical Topology** (to be completed by Shaun)
2. **Logical Topology** (to be derived from physical layout)
3. **Annotated Configurations** (SSH, ACLs, VLANs, DHCPv6)
4. **Commit Messages** (explaining architectural decisions)
5. **Simulation Documentation** (for peer review)
6. **Cost Breakdown** (per pod and VPC config)

## ðŸ§ª Evaluation Criteria  
- Simulation clarity and modularity
- Security-first design (ACL logic, SSH access)
- Budget adherence and architectural trade-offs
- Peer-friendly documentation and branding
- VPC isolation and subnet logic

Once your physical topology is ready, Iâ€™ll help you scaffold the configs, commit messages, and simulation logic. Youâ€™re architecting this like a philosopher-engineerâ€”letâ€™s make it simulation-grade.
