🧱 **1. Architecture**
- **Fat (wired-centric) architecture** as base design: core, distribution, access layers.
- **Dual wireless architecture**: use both Autonomous APs and Lightweight APs via WLC.
- Define **AP groups**:
  - `Guest_AP_Group` → VLAN 20 (restricted Internet-only access)
  - `Staff_AP_Group` → VLAN 10 (full internal access via firewall control)

---

### 🛠️ **2. Core Technologies**

#### 📡 **IP Addressing & DHCP**
- **IPv4 DHCP**:
  - Central DHCP server in Distribution layer.
  - Configure scopes for each VLAN.
- **IPv6**:
  - Use **SLAAC** on routers for quick stateless config.
  - Combine with **DHCPv6** on access routers for full host provisioning.

#### 🔄 **Routing Protocols**
- Mix protocols across LAN segments:
  | Segment        | Protocol |
  |----------------|----------|
  | Core ↔ HQ       | OSPF     |
  | Branch A       | EIGRP    |
  | Branch B       | RIP      |
  | External (Internet-facing) | BGP      |

### 🔐 **3. Security & Control**

#### 🔒 VLANs & Inter-VLAN Routing
- Use router-on-a-stick (subinterfaces).
- Enable **DTP access** and **manual VLAN assignment**.
- Prevent **VLAN hopping**:
  - Disable unused ports.
  - Set ports to `switchport mode access` explicitly.
  - Use private VLANs or manual ACLs.

#### 🔌 Trunking
- Ethernet trunk on uplink ports from access switches to distribution.

#### 🔥 ACLs & Firewall
- Use standard and extended ACLs at edge routers.
- Apply firewall rules on border routers for guest vs. staff access.

#### 🛂 AAA, RADIUS & TACACS+
- Centralized AAA on server.
- RADIUS for wireless user authentication.
- TACACS+ for device management.

### 📶 **Wireless Components**
- Set up **WLAN Controller** with specified AP groups.
- Configure traffic path separation:
  - **Service traffic (data)**: routed through distribution switches.
  - **Control traffic (CAPWAP)**: routed directly to controller IP.
- Independent APs: configure manually via CLI.

---

### 📦 **Other Services**
- **NAT/PAT**: use PAT on edge router for Internet access.
- **SNMP & SSH**: Enable on routers/switches for monitoring and secure management.
- **NTP**: Connect all devices to central NTP server.
- **Web, DNS, Email Servers**: Host on server VLAN, assign static IPs, ensure DNS resolution and MX records.

---

### 📡 **IPv6 Anycast Configuration**
- Use same anycast address (e.g., `2001:db8::1`) for DNS replicas on different branch servers.
- Configure routers to advertise route to nearest DNS instance.

---

### 📐 **Subnetting Suggestions**
- Use VLSM for efficient IP allocation.
  - VLAN 10 (Staff): /24
  - VLAN 20 (Guest): /25
  - Server VLAN: /28
  - Management VLAN: /30

### 📁 Deployment Steps in Packet Tracer
1. Build your topology with labeled layers.
2. Implement VLANs and trunking.
3. Add routers, configure subinterfaces, routing protocols.
4. Set DHCP/DHCPv6 services.
5. Set up WLAN Controller and AP groups.
6. Add servers, configure AAA, NAT, and firewall.
7. Implement ACLs for segmented traffic.
8. Simulate traffic flows—validate connectivity and control paths.
