- I don't understand the deployment of a Nas server at all, so far, the cisco networks I did just connects the user to some access switch, that's all, so while AAA makes sense, teh deployment of NAS is confusing. But I understand NAS as telnet local authentication server. In your AAA configs, you didn't implement accounting, so do that two. Also config a standby radius server.

- i didn't understand the concept behind releasing an ip address, i though the request is sent to that the unchosen servers can retrieve their offers, but it also neccessary that they remove the ip address in their lists as it is in use.
- another question, my assumpion is that the server computes the current time and sends it to all clients. How does the protocol ensure the accuracy of the server's time itself?


- what is the limitation of ntp. can it be deployed at the main unit of a wan to sychronise the time of all the lans connected to it?

- imagine a scenario an icmp ping request is sent and the timestamp of the response is from the past. This will make the icmp statistics innacurate.

- the first configure request and its content (0.0.0)
- how the invalid ip is determined and a configure-nak sent containing an offered ip address
- why a second request is sent
- why an ACK packet is sent after it
- why the third and last configure request is sent

PPPoE packets
- 

PPPoE Discovery
- 

Evolution of WAN technologies
- Multiprotocol label switching:
- original purpose
- transit nodes using labels for paket forwading
- the obselence of the protocol from router perfomance improvements
- three scenarios suitable to the protocol: VPN, traffic engineering, and QOS scenarios

Traditional IP Routing and forwarding
- algorithm used for forwading
- downside:
- not good for end-to-end Qos guarantee
- routers need to contain network wide routes

MPLS label-based forwading
- use case
- connection orientation
- advantage
- Use of MPLSs instead of IP routes
- two modes of configuring and required protocol

MPLS Forwarding problems
-  downside of static label configuration
- one obvious advantage to this is that the predetermined path will remain consitent
- downside of dynamic label distribution, specifically in regard to path computation

PPPoE
- purpose
- broadband remote access server
- aspects of pp and ethernet that it integrates
- what is a remote accesss device
- how does dial-up access work
- how the protocol uses ethernet to connect host to the internet
- how it uses PPP for access control and accounting
- use case: enteprises and carrier networks
- the establish of P2P coonections over Ethernet
- the two devices in a ppp session
- what are carrier networks
- unique accounts for users

PPPoE packets:
- common prefix: PPOE Active Discovery
- Initiation packet (PADI) - code (0x09)
- Offer packet(PADO) - code (0x07)
- Request packet (PADR) - code (0x19)
- session-confirmation packet (PADS) - code (0x65)
- terminate packet (PPADT) -  code (0xa7)
- Fields of ethernet frames:
  standard - DMAC and SMAC
  Eth-type: used to distinguish between session (0x8864) and discovery packets (0x8863)
  - session ID: self-explanatory, typically matches DMAC and SMAC (2 bytes)
  - Length: packet length (2 bytes)
  - VER: pppoe version (0x01) (4 bits)
  - Type: indicates pppoe type (0x01) (4 bits)
- content of the PADS
- - the session ID of a PADI and PADR (0 X 0000)
- how a server is selected from multiple offers
- services comparison of the server's and the PADI (this answer why sometimes PPPoE server never respond)

PPPoE session stage
- PPP negotiation
- the data link as the outcome of the LCP phase
- Authentication of data link set up
- NCP outcome and common protocol: ICMP
- the identifier of packets after link establishment

PPPoE session establishment
- three stages: discovery, session, and termination
- three procedures involved in ppp negotiation: LCP negotiation, authentication, and NCP negotiation

Segment routing
- as an extension to existing BGPs and IGPs
- use of the source routing mechanism
- service defined networks
if all routers depended on the same central forwading table, how will that effect forwading perfomance.

SR fowarding
- means of dividing network paths
- assignment of SIDs to forwading nodes and adjacen paths
- general format is to append a common identifier
- format for adjacent links: xx
- format for forarding nodes: x
- what the format of ISDs depends on
- IPV6: SRv6
- MPLS labels: SR-MPLS
- what about SR for ipv4
- segment lists as an arrangement of SIDS that represent a forwading path
- how the segment list is contained in data packet and process by each node
- mode used to forward to next nodes, equal cost multiple path (ECMP)

SR Deployment mode
- the optionality of a controller
- parameters the ontroller computes on behalf of a source node: paths, information, and also reserves path resources
- two protcols used for or with it:
   NETCONF: network configuration protocol
   PCEP: path computation element communication protocol

SR application
- service based forwading paths
- the necessity of a controller for this mode

Network management and OM
- usefulness of network management
- two domains of network management: software or hardware management
- the nessecity of dedicated personnel for this service
- NE
- main control board to run NE software

Network management functions defined by OS
- configuration, performance, fault, security and accounting management

Traditional network management and O&M
- two modes:
  network admin: (using either the web or cLI mode)
  network management station: SNMP centralised management

SNMP
- use in centralised management
IMaster NCE-based network management and O&M
- cloud platform
- three feautures: control, management, and analysis
- AI feautures
- open programmability
- protocols used (NETCONF) and RESTCONF

Management through the CLI or web system
- suitability for small networks
- mastery expected on the admin
- limitation to large-scale networks
- workload with regard to network expansion
- vendor specific cli and web systems

SNMP-based centralised management
- three versions:
  SNNMP v1
  - year of release - 1990
  - limitations:
    - community name-based authentication
    - RFC 1157
    - few error codes
   SNMP v2

   - Internet engineering task force
   - RFC 1901
   - including GetBulk and Inform
   SNMP v3
   - improvement on previous version:
       user security encryption module based encryption  
       view based access control model

bandwidth based route selection
just call this available bandwidth route selection, cause ospf cost is bandwith based

SNMP architecture
- network management system as a network management centre
- agent processes running on managed devices
- snmp as a protocol for NMSs
- NMS server
- man-machine interfaces

SMNP message exchange
- two modes of message exchange:
  request/response (query or modify configurations)
  reporting faults to the nms
  
Managed objects
  can be a hardware components or a set of parameters
  advantage for unified management
  management information bases

MIB
- as a database containing variables mapping attributes of managed devices.
- set and queried by agent processes, and modified by management processes
- properties of MIBS:
    object identifier, status, acess permission, and data types of an object
- as a tree structure cointaining data on all NEs
- protocol independence of MIBs
- backward and forward compatibility of MIBS managed by nms
- compliance of MIB with new standards
- public MIBs and use case (structural design of protocols and standardisation of interfaces)
- private MIBs and use case (development of private protocols and special functions)
- as an extension of snmp interfaces
- object naming tree

SMNP Management model
query/modify operation
Trap operation
- predefined trigger events/conditions

SNMPv1
- get request, get-next request, set request (operations by the NMS)
- response (by the managed device)
- trap

SNMP v2c
- GetBulk
- Inform:
   addition of an acknowlegement from NMS (inform response)
   inform buffer
   retransmission mechanism and its two modes of its termination

SNMPv3
- improve through identify authentication and encryption
- identity authentication:
    verifying packets of agent process by nms and vice versa


rember that v2 is community based encryption. this verification of the nms's authority is important since attack may perform snmp nms spoofing. L

SNPM summary

   significance in outbound snmp traffic
   
Network management based on huwaei IMaster NCE
New challenges faced by the Network industry
- the explosive increase of traffic arising from innovative services like VR/A
- the GIV for global volume of data in 2025: 180 zerabytes

Huwaei IMaster NCE
- two functions: network automation and intelligence
- two management and control modes offered: 
   CLI and SNMP

- as a data modeling language to standardise NETCONF data content
- properties of modeling objects: configuration, status data, rpcs, and notifications.
- YANG file types:
    vendor proprietary
    IETF standard
    OpenConfig

- the conversion from XML to YANG to extract data

Telemetry Overview
- data collection from virtual and physical devices
- use of the push mode
- data colllected: interface traffic statistics, CPU usage, and memory usage
- streamig and model-driven telemetry
- can the devices managed by telemetry modify the intervals at which it sends data to the telemetry nms

IPV6 Basics
- ipv4 standardisation (1981) - IETF - RFC (791, that is the only rfc i'm willing to read)
- format of ipv4 addresses
- another name for ipv6 (IPng)
- length of ipv6 addresses (128 bits - 16 btyes - ipv4 is four bytes)

IPV4 exhaustion
- the even allocation of the remaining 4.68 million address to regional internet registers in 2011 by IANA
- The five RIR:
    AFRINIC - (Africa information centre), servers Africa
    RIPE - (Reseaux IP Europeans) - servers central Africa, Middle East and Central Asia
    LACNIC - (Latin American and Caribbean Internet Address Registry) - servers Central and South America, and the Carribeans
    ARIN: (American registry for internet numbers) - servers North American and select Carribean regions
    APNIC - (Asia Pacific Network Information Centre) - servers Asia and the Pacific
- two technologies used to delay ipv4 in the 1990s, NAT and CIDR.

IP4 vs IPV6 advantages
- ip address exhaustion
- broadcast radiation from ARP packets
- ineffiency table query 
- large routig table

IPV6 on the aforemetioned
- nearly infinite address space (can address each grain of sand in the world. (8 x 10^28 improvement on IPV4).
- hierarchical address structure: addresses are divided into ranges based on application
- Plug and play through slaac
- ESE network integrity through the obselence of NAT, which tampers with E2E packets.
- enhanced security through IPsec
- high scalability through packet header extensions
- improved mobility through the elimination of triangle routes
- enhanced qos 

IPV6 Packet
Fields:
Version: 4 bits long. Used to identify the ip version of the packet. IPv6 is set to 6.
Traffic class: 8 bits long: identifies the class or priority of an ipv6 packet.
Flow label: 20 bits: used to identify a data flow, used in conjuction with the source address for QOS control.
Next header: 8 bits long. Identifies the type of the first included extension header.
Source and destination address: self explanatory, 128 bits long
Hop limit: 8 bits long, TTL equivalent
Payload length, 16 bits long, used to identify the length of the PDU and the extension headers

IPv6 extension headers
- the extension header length field: 8 bytes
- the extension header length set to an integer mutliple of 8 for faster processing
- the extension header data field: variable length
- as an improvement to the IPv4 options field, which increases packet length from 20 to 60 bytes and consumes resources of intermediate nodes.
- palacement of extensions fields between PDUs and the ipv6 header
- variable number of extension fields
- special handling as a condition for adding extension fields
- the dynamic length for extension headers
- the ipv6 field doesn't have a procotol field, so how is icmp executed
- what the next header field of an extension header identifies

Order of extension header when the packet contains more than 1.
1. Hop-by-Hop Optionsheaders: optional info to be examined by every node in the packet's path
2. Destination Options header: carries optional info meant for the receipient device
3. Routing header: Optional information meant for intermediate nodes to be visited on the way to the destination
4. Fragment header: used to send a packet longer than the path MTU
5. Authentication header: used by IPsec for authentication, data integrity and replay protection
6. Encapsulating security payload (ESP): used by IPsec for authentication, data integrity and replay protection, and confidentiality of IPv6 packets.
 

two additional extension headers: Mobility header - used in mobile IPv6 to support mobile nodes operations.
No next header: Indicates that there's no upper-layer protocol
S
IPv6 address
- the length is 128 bits
- divided into eight segments in dotted hexadecimal notation
- each segment is 16 bits long
- case insensitivity of the characters in the address
- similarity to IPv4 for subnet numbers

IPv6 address abbreviation specification
- the ommision of leading 0s but keeping one zero if the segment only has zeros. 
- Trailing 0s cannot be ommited
- adding double colons to represent consecutive 0s segments
- only one instance of double colons is allowed, otherwise the address cannot be resolved to its original form

IPv6 Address location
- use of IPv6 prefix to identify unicast, multicast, and anycast addresses

Unicast addresses
- three types: GUA (2000::/3), ULA(FD00::/8), and LLA(FE80::/10)
- loopback address: 0.0.0.0.0.0.0.1/128 or ::1/128 use in testing system software or protocols
- unspecified address: 0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0/128 or ::128 and use in DHCPv6 or NS messages
 
Multicast address
- use by multicast groups
- as a replacement to broadcast addresses

Anycast address
- sent to the first node with the specified address

IPV6 Unicast Address
- two parts of a unicast address:
     network prefix: variable number of bits
     Interface ID: consist of the remainder bits after network prefix, like IPv4
     requirement for the two parts is that each should be 64 bits
      global IPv6 that start with 000 can work with non-64-bits network prefixs

Interface ID of an IPv6 Unicast address
- 3 methods to compute it: 
    manually
    automatically by the system
    IEEE 64-bit standard
- length: 64 bits
- the use of the interface ID on the GUA and LLA network prefixes.
- the use of the MAC adress to generate it:
   7th bit inversion
   Inserting FFFFE

Global unique address
- as an IPv4 public address equivalent
- aggregatable GUA
- size of network prefix and interface ID
- global routing prefix - assigned by providers to organisations: 45 bits long
- subnet ID: used to divide subnts based on requirements

Unique local address
- private address equivalent
- components:
    Global ID - 40 bits (generated by a pseudo-random algorithm with a low conflict probability)
- used address segments: FC00::/7, FD00::/8, and FC00::/8 segment

Local link address
- limited application with local links
- network prefix: FE80::/10
- each interface must have an LLA
- components:
    the 10 bit network prefix
    a 54 bit segment fixed at 0
    an interface ID

IPv6 multicast address
- components:
   8 bits for the network prefix
   4 bits for the flag:
     - used to highlight permanent or transient groups
     - 0000 to signify well-known groups
     - 0001 t0 signify transient groups
   4 bit scope:
     - to highlight thhe scope of the multicast group
     - 0 and F are reserved
     - 1 interface-loop scope, used for loopback transmission of multicast
     - 2, link local scope
     - 5 site local, and 8 organisation-local scope
     - E global scope
   4 but group ID:
     - to highlight the multicast group ID

Solicited-node multicast address
- limitation to local link
- use case: neighbor discovery and duplicate address detection
The transmision of ARP requests
- the destination address of ARP requests for MAC addresses as solicited-node multicast addresses, and how this facilitates one-to-one transmission

IPv6 anycast address
- use for source or destination of packets
- format similar to unicast
- use for service redundancy:
   through an analogy of a distributed server architecture
- load balancing through the optimal route selection rules

Service process of IPv6 unicast address
- two main addresses for interfaces:
   GUA - Manual configuration, SLAAC (NDP), and stateful address autoconfiguration (DHCPv6)
   LLA - Manual configuration, generated by the system, and dynamically by EUI-64

NDP
- RFC 2461 
- the neighbor disovery protocol
- components:
   SLAAC, DAD, and address resolution
- SLAAC as an improvement on manual configuration of IP addresses
- messages used by SLAAC: RS and RA 
- messages used by DAD and address resolution: NS and NA

Dynamic IPv6 address configuration
- stateful and stateless autoconfiguration

DHCPv6 address allocation
- both flags set to 1
- dependence of reliable server architecture
- the M and O flags
- stateful address configuration use in wired terminals

SLAAC address allocation
- both flags set to 0
- periodic advertisement of RA messages
- use of RS messages to obtain RAs
- Use of DHCPv6 as a supplement, M set to 0, and O set to 1
- use case of SLAAC, and IoT devices as a perfect example
- the simple network time protocol adapted from NTP
- Network information sytem: used to manage config files

DAD
use case
Step 1: Sending an NS message to the solicited-node multicast address in multicast mode
- source address as the unspecified IP address
- destination address: solicited-node multicast address
Step 2: Devices that aren't part of the multicast group discard the messages, while those that make part of it parse it to compare it to their own local interface address
- if the address is identified, then an NA is sent
- destination address of the NA as the multicast group
- the MAC address returned in the NA
- so if a devices has already obtained an IPv6 address, will it stop receiving RAs, and if so, wouldn't that make SLAAC stateful?
- and are period RAs broadcasted, and if so, doesn't this lead to broadcast radiation?
Step 3: the address is identified as in use through the NA
-what is the algorithm used to determine another address if the first is identified as in use. Is the mac address method still used, but treated differently?

Address resolution
- use of NS and NA
- NS message sent directly using the node-solicited multicast address
'
Difficulty in locating and anlysis network faults
- Difficult to spot faults
- manual fault, identification, and diagnosis
- 85% of network fault coming from service complaints
- 3.65% of flows accounted abnormal
- device indicators not correlating to user experience

Slow netwok service deployment
- Network policies: Access, bandwidth, Qos, and otehr policies.
- service network VN for office, scientific, and video survelliance.
- inefficiencies include: complex and inflexible network policy changes, long service deployment policy, and low physical network deployment efficiency.
- vision to improve the aforementioned:
- plug-and-play of devices
- quick deployment
- mobility based on policies
- ZTP deployment on the physical network

SDN origin
- developed by the Clen Slate program at Stanford university
- separates the control plane from the data plane of devices for centralised control
- three elements: forwarding-control separation, unified control, and open programmable interfaces
- architecture: SDN application, open flow controller, and open flow switches

Basic concepts of OpenFlow
- as an SBI protocol between a controller and the switch
- three types of messages: controller-to-switch (used to query by a controller), asynchronous (intiated by a switch after a status change),and symmetric (sent by either the controller or device).

Controller-to-switch messages:
- feature message sent to request switch information and response including interface name, mac address, and interface rate.
- send-packet message: sent to a specific interface of a switch
- configuration message: sent to queryor set the switch status.
- read-state message: sent to collect statistics on the switch
- modify-state messages: used to modify the flow table and set interface attributes of the switch

Asynchronous messages:
- flow-removed message: sent to the controller after the timeout interval of an entry has been triggered. Also sent when an entry has to be deleted
-port-status message: sent to notify the controller when interface states change
- packet-in message: sent by a switch if no matching entry is found in the table
- packet-out message: sent to respond to a switch

Symmetric messages:
- hello messages: as the first packets exchanged. The comparison of OpenFlow version through the version field in the packet and the smaller version being selected.
- echo messages: as bidirectional packets used to test latency
- error messages: self-explanatory. 
What error message would a controller want to send to the switch.

FLow table overview
- match field: a field against which a packet is matched. The are various options, inclding: layer 2 and 3 packet headers, layer 4 port numbers, and inbound interface.
- used for forwading by openflow switches
- timeouts: aging time of flow entries:
   idle time: if no packet matches the flow entry after this time, then the flow entry is deleted
    hard time: deletes a flow entry irregardless of packet matches
- instructions: actions executed after packet match of flow entry
- priority: matching sequence of flow entries.-
- flags: modifies management mode entries
- cookie: used to identify the flow entry delivered by the controller

Essential requirements of SDN
- allows for centralised control in the global view to facilitate fast service deployment (additionally, it supports what I call duplicate service deployment), traffic optimization, or network service openness
- advantages:
   automatic optimization
   shields technical differences
   builds an open network
SDN and NFV overview
- SDN and NFV as the main proponents in the evolution of networking

Evolution of the computer Era
- the development of the IBM system/360 in 1964
- centralised architecture of mainframes
- use case in processing large-scale transaction data
- use of dedicated elements in comparison to PCs
- three factors that accelerate innovation in the PC industry:
   open-source systems, software-defined, and a hardware substrate

Current situtation of the network industry
- three planes each network device has: control, forwarding and management plane.
- advantages of current networks: standardized protocols, compatibility amongst vendors, and network convegence after fault toularence
- the functions of the forwarding plane - providing high speed data channels for servuce modules. Includes technologies like, Layer 2, Layer 3, ACL, QOS, multicast, and security protection.
Management plane - various functions like system monitoring, environment monitoring, log and alarm processing, system loading and upgrading. Technologies include, web, ssh, telnet, smnp, and RMON, and huwaei NCE

Problems in the network field
- frequent network congestions, difficult O&M, slow service deployment, and complex network technologies.

Frequency network congestion
solutions:
- bandwidth based route selection
- tunnel path adjustment

Complex network technologies
solutions:
- many network protocols
- vendor-specific relearning

NFV architecture
- NFVI on which virual NEs run, creating cloud based resource pools.
- VFN as software-based NEs, created using cloud resources
- management and ochestration (MANO)
- vendor specific layers of the architecture
- two main layers of the NFVI:
    COTS - hardware layer, for universal hardware (Huawei FusioServer)
    CloudOS - virtualisation layer - a cloud operating system used to manage and orchestrate resources—such as compute, storage, and networking—across a cloud infrastructure.
- VNF and MANO

NFV architecture interfaces
- come back tommorow, not fundamental

Huwaei NFV solution
- NFVI plaftorm: Huwaei Cloud Stack

What Is MANO in NFVI?
MANO is the control layer that manages the lifecycle, orchestration, and resource allocation of VNFs running on NFVI. It ensures that virtualized services are deployed, scaled, and maintained efficiently across distributed infrastructure.

(NFVO)
- Oversees the overall orchestration of network services and coordinates VNFs and resources across multiple VIMs

VNF Manager (VNFM)
- Handles lifecycle management of individual VNFs (e.g., instantiation, scaling, healing, termination)

Virtual Infrastructure Manager (VIM)
-  Manages compute, storage, and network resources in the NFVI (e.g., OpenStack, VMware)


- was a bit lost about designated ports, not every non root bridge has to set one, but only one port will exists in a specific stp domain/scenario.

- so does the switch determine its own optimal configuration BPDUs from the BPDUs generated by its own before comparing with the neighbors, for electing stp designated ports.

- The standardisation of protocols is something I don't see happening since they vary based on application. One thing I can recommend is a standardises CLI

- so how does the ascii mode differ from the bianry mode, because ascii is an encoding of characters in binary.

- additionally, the host.txt file represent an spof for the entire internet
- definitely coding ftp in python.

- didn't make sense at first, but the port P, greater than 1024, is a port number greater than the port numbers of well known applications, 0 - 1023. when the server needs to establish a tcp connection to the client for file transfer, it should know which port the client has opened, which is why the client sneds the port command after authentication

- so the port command packet will encapsulate a port but with a private ip address, which won't be translated by nat because that address is within the payload.

- practice these commands - acii, binary, LS, passive, get, and put.

- Also learn how to enable ftp on devices other than dedicated servers

- start with coding tftp, it's simple.
- modify if to allow ls command on the server. the limitation of not being able to view the server's file directory is senseless. How will you know which files to request.

Not details are given on the implementation of telnet, which is the most curious protocol of them all.

since you learning about ip address utilisation, don't forget to set the ip adress between networks to two hosts

- should also configure a router as a dhcp server, or some other device, other than a dedicated server.

- code a simulator of hosts.txt, nah, that's redundant.
SDN network architecture
- three orchestration layers and functions: application layer (service collaboration), controller layer (service orchestration), device layer (data forwarding).
- use of open interfaces to connect layers
- examples of upper layer applications, OSS (used for service orchestration of the entire network), OpenStack (used for service orchestration, compute, and storage resources)
- deployment of the SDN controller at the controller layer
- RESTful as an example of NBIs

Huwaei SDN network architecture
- supported SBI and NBI protocols: openFlow, snmp, restful, BGP, PCEP, OVSB, NETCONF, and RESTCONF.
- Element Network Management system (EMS) to manage nodes in telecommunication networks. 
- cloud-platforms: used for managing resources like, network, compute, and storage. OpenStack as the most mainstream open-source cloud platform
- orchestration (container orchestration) : provides network service orchestration function. Kurbenetes as a mainstream tool

Simplified ZTP deployment (based on a dc using spine-leaf architecture)
- trigger the ZTP process on IMaster NCE
- device obtains ip address to access IMaser NCE
- iMaster delivers snmp, netconf configurations based on device role, including management ip address.
- global delivery of configurations like ospf or BGP configs
- admin views network wide infotmation of online devices on IMaster NCE

Network intent self-understanding and fast service deployment
- theree steps and duration: design (2 to 3 days), implementation 10 minutes, testing (1 - 2 days)
- use of NETCONF by NCE-Fabric for service deployment
-through plaforms NCE-Fabric can inteconect with: cloud platform (OpenStack), virtualisation (System Centre), and for container orchestrastion (Kurbenetes).

Network change simulation and change risk prediction
- Data collection: including live network configs, network topology, and resource information
- Model and compute: Design physical, logical, and application network models. Verify computing with the formal verification algorithm
- Verification results: resource sufficency, acess connectivity, and impact on original services

AI-powered intelligent O&m for DCNs
-  threee stages
- Collection:
   Huawei 30 years expertise on O&M
   Continuous learning and training derived from real site faults
   DC holographic data
- Analysis:
   - identifying exception detection, root cause analysis, and risk prediction through the knowledge inference engine.
- Decision: maual rectification, intent-based loop closing

Huawei CloudCampus Autonomous driving network solution
- so at the top of everything runs imaster NCE, which interconnects services like Kurbenetes, OpenStack, and System Centre
- Fast service deployment: supports device plug-and-play, including template based configuration (another interesting trend). 
- fast service provisioning: intelligent terminal identification, free mobility, and HQoS

Device plug and play
- deployment through scanning bar codes, dhcp-based deployment, and deployment though the registration centre
- registration centre is part of the CloudCampus solution and is sued to query device management mode and registration ownership.

Free mobility: Policy management based on security groups
- independence of location for configured security policy
- create user groups, deliver groups, use for acces authentication, then enforce policies based on source and destination security groups.

Wired and wireless convergence
- WLAN construction modes:
   mode 1 separates wired and wireless authentication poinnts and management
   mode 2: AC card - adding an AC module to the switch for AC funnctions
   advantages of wired and wireless convergence: unified management, unified policy execution, and gateway convergence

Intelligent terminal idenfication for secure access
- built-in terminal fingerprint library
- feautes: automatic authorisation, spoofing detection, and automatic authentication

Application based QOS
- limitation of Qos policies for video services.

Network automation
- automation of network deployment, operations, and O&M
- open source technologies: Ansible, SaltStack, Puppet, and Chef.

Progamming-based network automation
- neccesity of python programming skills for new engineers

Programming language
- compiled language vs interpreted language
- three classes of languages: machine language, assembly language, and high-level language
- machine language as being directly executable by machines
- high-level languages have to be translated first
- examples of high-level languages: C, C++, Java, Python, Pascal, Lisp, Prolog, Fortran, and FoxPro

Computing technology stack and program execution process
 - computing technology stack: 
     levels above the ISA (software): machine code, assembly language, high-level language, algorithm, and application
- levels below ISA (hardware): Micro architecture, gates/registers, transistors, and physical materials
- program execution process: compile high-level language to assembly, use assembler to convert from assembly to machine code, and, lastly, execute the machine code.

Compiled high-level programming language
- examples: C/C++, and Go
- linker using the link library to combine object code into a final executable, resolving dependencies.

Intepreted high-level programming languages
- examples:Java and Python
- interpreted languages don't need to be compiled first
- Virtual machines to execute source code generated by the compiler
- PVM: python VM
- JVM: Java virtual machine language

python

- composed of letters, digits, and underscores
- data types: boolean, integer, floating point, and string

Code indentation
- use to distinguish a block of code
- comments: single-line (#) and multi-line ("""...""")

Source code file structure
- components: imported modules, interpreter, encoding format, document string (docstring), and code statements
- encoding formats: py 2 (ASCII),py 3 (UTF-8).

Python functions and modules
- modules as importable python files
- modules contain: functions, classes, and variables.

Python classes and methods

- use of inband signaling mode
- use of interpreter as command (IAC) byte to distinguish data and control commands
- escape mechanism to avoid data and control command conflict

Typical network architectures and practices
- different in locations for campus networks
- providing network access services for external users as an additional requirement for campus networks
- campus networks as networks that serve clinets in a specific geography
- one management unit as typical in campus networks
- two main technologies: 802.3 (ethernet) compliant and 802.11 compliant technologies

Typical Campus Network architecture
- classification based on NEs: small, mid-sized, or large.
- hirerarchical structure through layering
layers:
  - core layer - as a backbone of the network offering high-speed data transfer and interconnections various parts of the network, like the egress zone and data centre. Typical architecture includes dual switches and aggregated links.
- aggregation layer - perfoms the function of consolidating traffic to apply policies before passing it to the core layer.
- access layer - to connect edge devices to the network
- egress area - as the area used to connect the lan to other networks. Typically location to deploy security devices, like firewalls, intrusion prevention systems, ups, and anti-DDos devices.
- data center area: houses servers and applications that provide services to internal and external users.
- network management area - deploys services and devices meant to manage and monitor the entire network, including SDN controllers, snmp, telemetry, and web portals

Typical architecture of small campus networks
- suitable for a samll number of access users, about 200 terminals and 25 NEs
- limited to one location and has a small architecture

Typical architecture of midsize campus networks
- supported users: 200 to 2000 people
- supported NEs: 25 to 100
- introduces modular design
- reliance on service requirements
- small number of function modules
- three layers: core, aggregation and acess

Typical architecture pf large campus networks
- covers multiple buildings and connects multiple WANs through leased cables
- use of VPNs
- users: upward of 2000 and NEs upward of 100
- complex architecture, function modules, and modules

Main protocols and technologies of campus networks
- access layer: vlan, stp, link aggregation, and AAA
- aggregation layer: DHCP, stacking (iStack), link aggregation, spanning tree, ospf, and statc routing
- core layer: stacking, ospf, static routing, and ACLs
- egress zone: NAT, PAT too, static routing, and PPPoe

Network solution design
- the influence of budget and service requirements on the physical topology
- consistent naming and interfaces reflecting bandwith requirements

VLAN design
- three classification of VLANs: service, management, and interconnection VLANs
- service vlan assignment options: assigned by geography, personnel/departmental structure, service type, and logical area.
- use of VLANIF interface addresses as management addresses
- reserving a management address for layer 2 devices
- vlan for capwap tunnels between APs nd ACs

IP address design
- specifically for gateways and servers (keep in mind that these addresses should remain consistent, so dhcp won't assign, so paln beforehand)
- using consistent rightmost digits to match services

IP address planning
- assigning segments based on network segments
- reserving sufficient address based on the number of clients

IP address allocation mode
- obtaining ip addresses of egress gateways in advance (since they are assigned by ISPS)
- three modes of address assignment by carriers: static, DHCP , and PPPoE
- statically bound ip addresses for service terminals
- dhcp assigned addresses of end users
- egress routing design for small and midsized LANs
- two forwading options for WLAN: direct or centralised forwarding
- additional requirements for wlan design:
    - network coverage design for signal strength and minimal signal interference in each area
    - network capacity design to ensure bandwidth requirements, expected concurency rate, and per-AP perfomance
    - AP deployment design ensures sufficient power supply, deployment mode, and deployment position
    - include security and roaming design

-  configuring the aggregation as the root bridge for stp
- configuring an eth truck between access and aggregation switches

Security design
- enabling dhcp snooping to prevent dhcp-enabled devices from causing private address conflicts

Network O&M and Management design
- use of telnet, web portals, and SSH, when the admin's device and network devices are routable. Including SNMP-based NMSs

Network optimisation
- device perfomance optimisation: hardware and software upgrade
- network optimisation: optimising network architecture and routing proto adjustment
- service qualiy optimisation: like preferential fowarding of voice and video services





- what are the security considerations of management through remote access, like should an admin be onsite or accross layer 3, what about sniffing?



- makes sense that static nat should be used in situtations with multiple static addresses, other you will be mapping public address to reserved private address

- what is WAC and eLog?

- what is a demilitarised zone?

- what is the use of dad with eui-64 interface ids, since they based on mac addresses

- I should write scripts for my current project, save time. Already have ideas, shit is to easy, use ai for it can again, this is network engineering, not coding. for example, think of generate config file I can use for my configs, in fact, imma use it, function to generate command for ip address, for example, the function takes two arguments, interface number and ip adress, then returns the commands, this can be done for vlans, adding networks to advertise for vlans and ospf process id and router id, and the function generates the required configs, so to finish my project quicker, i should configure remote access to all devices, write my python scripts, use that shit to generate commands, then just copy and paste. so vibe coding is a wonderful development for fields like network engineerinng, where implementation doesn't matter more than the expexted function, just tell ai your script requirements, then done. then your code should write the configs to a database or texfile for config rollback, maybe do this for the third project


- what are the implications of NFV with regards to security
- since there's a high reluctance to adpot NFV, it can form a good backup for outages. Additionally, let say a network has lost a crucial edge router, ordering one and receiving it on time isn't simply, so a virtual router can be used temporarily, this to me changes how spof should be tackled on networks. buying more physical nodes to eliminate spof is not cost effective. In short, the number of additional standby nodes depended on the budget. but if a company maintains one cloud (NFVI) for spof, this can eliminate spof-related ddos attacks.

- imagine if you were hired to fix or troubleshoot a node in a legacy system with no documentation - just a plethora of cables that are twisted and spiral from one node to the next. What is the best way to mitigate an outage in such a system. Have an NFV to handle the compromised function temporarily before diving into figuring out the problem.


- does the imaster nce store the radio calibration data in a cloud, how often is the data deleted, what are the cost implementations for data storage?

- the necessity for automatic radio calibration is so obvious, the instabilility of the radio environment cannot be countered effectively through manual calibration. Nor can the engineering always be available to handle slight interferences.


- fast intelligence to improve network perfomance: historical-data based optimisation, precise and predicitive fault analysis, and real-time end-user experience visualisation.



- these fancy words hold no substance for the mind, but exception detection sounds interesting to me. Policies are built for networks and identifying probable exceptions lies on the engineer's expertise - liable to human limitation and error, so if you could have a model that can help id exceptions for your networks configs while you implement, that will make things easier.
- network optimisation based on real-time historical data is the only optimisation with a real-time effect, compared to optimising by adding random features that sound interesting to you. for example, a move from static to ospf may not actually be optimal, maybe for a small network the excessive adjacency establishment may worsen latency.


what is holographic data




- what is the formal verification algorithm.

- wonder how ems is used, how do you connect to cell phone towers?

- learn one of these interesting apps, OSS and OpenStack

- what are SBIs? and NBIs?

- who sets the traps on the managed devices.


SBIs are southbound innterfaces used for communication between the controller and the managed devices. Protocol examples: Openflow, Netconf, OVSDB.
NBIs are northbound interfaces used for communication between the application and the controller. Protocol examples: Rest APIs.

- (additionally, it supports what I call duplicate service deployment). if the managed devices have a set of common configs, the sdn controller can easily flood them. can devices of different vendor be managed by the same sdn controller/software?

- interestingly, if an sdn uses an app, then multiple admins can connect to the app from different interfaces, which is a better approach compared to clis and nms'. Because of these apps, cloud management of the network is simplified.

- southbound interface - the interface between the sdn controller and data plane devices

- the main difference of sdn from nms is that the latter requests and modifies the control plane, while sdn is a complete separation of the control plane from the managed device

- what is ZTP. zero touch provisioning, offered by cloud APs for example.

so I have a first hand experience from a network simulator with the complxity invloved with spotting faults so I think a solution is necessary for that.


- so it didn't make sense that the system itself can general a unique address. But because it generates it based on a mac adress - a unique identifer, the resulting ip address will also be unique.

- magic numbers are mappped to sender packets in lcp, if a packet receivd contains the node's magic number, then that will imply a loop.

- the mru seems the only parameter that can be renegotiated since the authentation on both ends aren't meant to sync. But the magic number can be a mismatch if identical on both ends.
- what's a VRP?

- what is IPv6 neighbour discovery?

- what is meant by a local link?
- The local link is the link to which a device is connected.

- what are neighbor solicitation messages?

since ip address exhaustion is not a concern in IPv6, is CDIR also used in it.

- I already have an idea of how the next header field in the main header may improve processing efficiency. For example, intermediate routers are expected to only process the hop-to-hop and routing extension headers, which have specific numbers used to identify them. Therefore, if the first next header contains neither of these numbers, it can assume that none of the extensions are intended for it and just pass the packet.

 which path MTU is this refering too. the one between the sender and first hop - (the gateway) cause I don't think senders can compute the entire path MTU from source to destination
- interesting idea, how do sta send probe requests that don't contain ssid. this is a broadcast mode of some sort, in wired networks, you just send a broadcast packet to an access switch, but there's no dedicated switch you can send wlans to in a wlan, but the textbook states the probe request is sent on supported channels. in short, i just don't understand how an sta may send packets to unidentified packkets

- what is E2E communication?
- direct communication from sender to receive without intermediary node access

This is an overview of how slaac works. ipv6 routers send router advertisements to hosts, the RA contains parameters like the network prefix, the device generates a unique identifier using its mac address and combined that with the network prefix to form a complete ipv6 address. And uses the duplicate address detection to verify the uniqueness of the compted ip address

- what is clasless inter-domain routing? is subneting, which also expands the number of ips, for example, imagine a network with four subnets. before cidr, four different ip adresses will be used. but with cdir, the same address will be subnetted.


- learn about trial running, rollback upon errors, and configuration callback (sounds like version control for configs)

- not c, not b

- BEEP

- SOAP

- if high power APs can interfere with other APs, can an attack be done a wlan by randomly deploying APs or other radio devices to interfere with the signals of the wlan?

apparently packets sent in a bbs must contain a bbsid

- I couldn't make sense of the difference or at least the necessity of the join request after the discovery request?

- are STAs in the same service set communicating at layer 2

- technically, cellular network of ess through bsc

- thought an ssid was used to identify multiple APs, but each ap is a wlan, the ssid is more readable as it is not a mac address
machine to machine simplity refers to automated processes between two devices


so the main difference of netconf is that one device represents all managed devices, instead of having multiple agent processes scattered on managed devices
infrared rays?
what are the other standards available for wlans. And does regulations influence the predominace of the 802.11 standards?

why did wifi 5 drop the 5GHZ frequency band. Or why di wifi 6 bring back the 2.4 GHz frequency band

there's no command specified to create a trap, as a predefined event, unless snmp comes with default trap modules

- look up waveLAN

- so the agile distributed architecture makes a lot of sense. imagine a wlan that doesn't have a dedicated AC, but on the other hand, the densely distributed AP should use some unified management, in that case, an AP with some AC-like softare can handle the procedure, of managing a few other APs

in wlans, snmp seems redundant since the ac acts as a nms

- in a wlan proje, try connecting an ac to an aaa server
- are there cloud routers and switches. Cloud management is too good for other network devices to not enable it.

- what about a batch set request? It's get bulk, nah that's different

- what is lexicographic order?
- the comparison of characters in strings from left to right
- alphabetic ordering of strings or sequences.

- besides the ease with which networks can be managed with snmp, doesn't this agent and manager transmission increases the vulnerability scope of the network, maybe not, maybe snmp processes are established over secure ssh channels. and the otehr modes of network management, be it telnet or even ssh itself, can be said to make the network vulnerable by having configs transmitted through the network, however, it is unsound to expected network admins to configure each device on the network locally, through a console port.

- the simplest trigger event of a trap operation is a shutdown of an interface/or channel to the nms, but maybe that's false cause how will the trap messages be delivered, but either way, an example similar to that.

- when you code something related to managed objects, code something that displays active interfaces on your agent processes.

- is inevitable that enteprises develop private MIBs, besides developing proprietary protocols, they can also be used to script company specific attributes of managed objects.

I can presume that the managed objects is limited as the object cannot growth too large. each device can have a set of managed objects apparently, I thought there was a one-to-one relationship between an object and a decive, either was this mode can be useful for complex configurations

there should have been a sort of standardisation for network configs

- there's also a northbound api, don't know what the is

- what is telemetry

- never did the console port in packet tracer. have used the web based method for wlan management in an lan controller, not enough though


- so my interest is in sofware management then, handling network applications with socket programming and stuff. The module doesn't go deeper into this, you'll have to find secondary material.

- so are routers configured to not route packets with private addresses. They should be configured thus, others they packets can't be routed on the internet


- stop at 790

- do transport layer ports differ from network application ports?

- the use case of easy ip is interesting, since most LANs are connected to ISPs, the public addresses assigned to a LANs egress device will dynamically change.


- so within a specific session, a private address is mapped to a public address, which still keeps the 1 to 1 contrainst
- how is ipcp used to configue ips for domain name servers

- so, since the client selects a server preferentially, what parameter does it compare. For example, in ac discovery throough dhcp the ac priority or number of connected AP is compared. Got it, its first-come first-server. This actually makes sense because to have a merit based option is senseless since all responses are sent by servers that can handle the service requirements specified in the PADI.

  
interestingly, the kurose modules asserts that the trasport layer can offer a reliable service over unrealiable ip. My assumption of a method this could be implemented is through packet retransimmision. If the transport layer can keep retransmitting for a certain number of times, then eventually the packet will go through, the transport layer can offer security over insecure ip through encrpytion, that way, even if the packet is sniffed, it will be senseless to the attacker.





just what I thought: SID Stack Deep-Dive
A SID stack is like a recipe for packet traversal. Each SID in the stack is popped off as the packet progresses. Wouldn't make sense eventually if the top id remained the destination's id, cause now the intermediate nodes should also be identified and should also remove their identifers as a packet passes.

Two 
- so is the segment list sorted to set the destination SID of the packet at the top of the segment link? 
- i'm quite confused about the authentication process, so apparently the devices on both ends can have different protocols, ok. if i'm r1, is the authentication protocol on my end meant to authenticate me, or my peer. In the image, it seems like it is meant for the peer. Secondly, should people running the devices on opposite ends, know each other or be working together, cause that seems like the only way either can store each other's password and username for authentication beforehand, so I'm really confused. Lastly, for two ends, seems lik two authenticators will be running

if R2 accepts the parameters in the request, then why should R2 also send a request, why not send the info in a ack packet

- so since redundancy is used to ensure continuity, do WNAS use redundant links considering their costly infrastructure.

I wonder how wireless wnas work, they seem more interesting because of scalability.

- the tunnel forwarding mode seems to bring spof to the network. Speaking of that, is there an AC aggregation techology, like iStack for switches. But in a wlan-centric network, Having various ac as aggregation switches seems like a smoth design.

- how does 802.1X work?

since the Association request is passed to the AC, how is it processed in a Fat AP architecture.

Association
- how about layered encyption at the trasport layer to enhance network security even further. But user-perceived time will increase the longer the decryption. but for special networks, it is conceivable
- how does wep 3 differ

- this ssid hiding and vap system is interesting. You wlan can be divived into VAPS, one for staff and the other for guest. Specify a higher bandwidth for staff, maximum users, and hide the SSID. then limit all the workers traffic to this vap, then another vap for guests with a visible vap and less strict security policies.

- this is something I wondered of, like a user in a wired network consumes bandwith afforded by his link, whereas users who connect to an AP, aren't neccesarily assigned a channel mapped to a bandwidth amount, unless I'm mistaken or not making sense. Therefore, if a lot of users connect to the network, then the bandwidth possible for each will decrease to very low levels. At least with specifying maximum users we can rely on the wlan not carrying more traffic than it can handle.

- but I'm still uncertain if capwap tunnels use UDP for data packets


- if a wlan has a hidden ssid, then how will the STA disover it? The STA will directly add the network in their STA.

- isn't the prevention of signal interference handled by the calibration function?

but how do you determine the actual WLAN environment, or am I confusing that with the radio environment?

wlan tech is a bit complex, but at any rate the ap has a certain bandwith, so can we specify how much bandwith an VAP may have as QOS.

- What should ACs be assigned ip addresses by dhcp servers? my assumption is that the Ac's ip address will be dynamic, based on the lease duration, making AC discovery complex.
- does creating an ap group automatically imply ESS?

- what are Beacon frames?

what's an SN?
- what is whitelisting?
what's an sftp server?
what's a calibration channel and bandwidth?

- isn't the automatic discovery insecure?

- how is an ac priority computed, or is it just based on the number of connected APs?

- can the network admin's pc be used as a dhcp server, after all, ip addresses are renewed daily and a small network does habe to plug and remove users incessantly.
- rember that an ac may be in a separate subnet from an ap, in which case the broadcast mode is impossible. 


- are the broadcast AC discovery packets sent to all devices, not just aps. If so, what is the effect of this broadcast radiation?

- I presume capwap tunnels have bandwidth rates, how about a protocol that mimicks eth-trunk to channel aggregation. 

- capwap uses UDP right. But with the in-path mode of acs, where the ac is the aggreagtion switch of aps, is all the traffic transmitted to the ac through udp, i'm asking this because capwap tunnels are udp connections
 
- I don't understand the process of ACs assigning ip addresses to APs, when the process of discovering Ac by ap is equally complex.
think about deploying ess as means to virualise the entire wireless network


- quite correlated to vlans. Vlans define the access scope of a broadcast domain, so in that sense, VAPs also segment the broadcast domain. Therefore, vaps can be used for qos, provided we can specify parameters like bandwidth and packet priority for a vap.

so like do these capwap channels have bandwidth rates?

Layer 3 networking
- distribution of APs
- - AC discovery

- what is an AC?

- what is infrared?

- just came up with a mwthod of implementing qos, since I don't even know how its done. So if we want to gurantee bandwidth for some departement, configure an acl on some redundant link to allow traffic only from that department, implement that. can acls be deploted at layer 2, you asking cause of inter-vlan, maybe deploy acls on sub interfaces, sounds complex.

- though about the neccesity of rule insertion but remember that acls are typically interpreted sequentially. So if you think a rule has a higher precedence, you can insert it at the right position.
- the least significant bit is the only odd number, therefore all odd ip addresses will include it. Therefore, even ip adresses should merely exclude it, the wildcard will be 000000001.

- what's an STA

- what is a ucl

imagine the unreliablility of the internet if it depended on the NIC.

- what is CC

- look up status detection with respect to firewalls

- in cisco packet tracer we did the manual mode, because we had to duplicate configurations on both ends.
- I dont understand the selection of active interfaces? what if a device has three links to another device, why should active interfaces be computed at all, shouldn't all three interfaces be selected by default? maybe in relation to maximum interfaces.
interestingly, the configuration of the maximum active interfaces allows us to create a unique implementation of smart link.

- how does dynamic NAT distinguish if an address is in use or not. My assumption was that if an outbound packet is sent, the source address is translated to the correponding public address, and therefore if a packet hasn't been returned such that NAT retranslates it to it's corresonding private address, from that we can tell if a public address is still in use. My explanation is nonsense though, what if the source translated packet doesn't get a return packet.

- so easy IP is probably used by ISPs because the IP addresses they assign are dynamic.
to keep a network private even if it accesses the internet, create an acl for an egress device to block inbound traffic with ip addresses that don't match statically configured NAT public addresses or addresses in the dynamic pool.

- I assume that ISPs are assigned a range of public address by some standardisation organisation. Static Nat is not feasible for ISPS.

- dynamic NAT is interesting. Assuming that ISPS are assigned ip address ranges when registered, with static NAT, the range assigned is the number of possible clients for the ISP. Of course the range can be made to be large enough to never be exhausted, but that contributes to the issue of IPV4 address shortages. With dynamic NAT, a smaller range is possible since addresses can be reused.

- but for dynamic Nat to work implies that ISPS track the user's internet access activity. They do, remember they use AAA, so maybe through AAA accounting.  

- do ISPs use private addresses for their users and then maybe translate these address when packets have to be redirected out of the ISPs infrastructure
- do public addresses collide in the internet
- is a specific private adress mapped to a specific public adress or is the address allocated dynamically.

- what if I configure terminals in my LAN to use public addresses for intranet communication

- the topology of adjacencies if full mesh unless drothers are configured
- why doesn't accounting have a local mode?

non-preemption

what's a frame relay?

- whhat is the difference between an ARB nad a BR?

- are ospf adjacencies area-dependent?

- how and why do AS boundary routers import rotues

- is there a similar logical method of segementation for static routing as a mechanism to limit the routing table. That mechanism would be required in a large network which already uses dynamic routing so it desn't seem necessary.

- what are the limitations of Drothers in terms of packet exchange. the limitation has to do with adjacencies, one drother one an ma is furtile

- design a protocol for point-to-multipoint communication, employing technologies from already learned protocols

- so lsdb synchronisation is done when adjacent routers have done all neccessary LSRs requests. How is the last LSR idenitified, is there a timer ofr LSRs

- what is ppp, besides being a protocol for point to point communication, how is it implemented

- the nas server creates a single  poinf of vulneribility for the network. A ddos tcp flooding attack on the server restricts users from connecting to the network.
secondly, remote authentication perfoms recursive requests, making the network liable to sniffing.

- is AAA distributed for a network that hadles a huge volume of access requests?

- in terms of network security, are lsdbs safe. An entire network topology is understood through an attack on a single router, as opposed to other round about means. So it the maintainance of lsdb safe in network securit terms.

- even though egp is sounds self-explanatory, what is the use of egd
- in terms of security, I wouldn't recommend an acl rule that permits all traffic to a lan's server even if a few preventive rules precede it, unless it's a server containing public objects like a web server.
- if a router connects one outbound interface and one gateway, then 2 acls at the gateway port will suffice because both outbound and inbound traffic will pass through the gateway port. Secondly, each standby port for outbound traffic will have to be configured individually, leading to duplication, as opposed to when the outbound acl is configured at the gateway port. Acl deployment is more complex than it seems with an increase in gateways and outbound interfaces.
how about a interface-based acl matching order, based on something similar to vlan interfaces. For example, som ports on a router will represent gateways while others represent outbound interfaces, therefore, if a gateway port receives a packet from another gateway port on the router, then it can apply a set of acls specific to the lan, as opposed to also trying to match the received traffic with acls related to putbound traffic. I'm not really making sense but I'm tryna highlight the complexity involved in designing acl deployments for a large network.

so what happens to packets that don't match any acl rule. are they discarded. Cause if they are neither permitted nor denied by rules in the acls, then we have to assume either of the two alternatives to be applied. An additional last rule is configured to either permit or deny all other traffic as the last option, as shown in the module

-look up a traffic filtering technology for cisco packet tracer.

- so an unphysical link failure and a root bridge have the same reconvegence
- when you specify both a source and destination ip address in an acl rule, are they meant to be applied simultaneously 

- since acls are processed sequentially, do they add to the packet transmission delay?
- here's a suggestion of how to implement an algorithm to decrease acl processing time, assuming this isn't done by default. Nah i'm not making sense. I was aiming at something though, the auto matching order type of point. Look it up the depth first principle.

- so 2 acl rules may conflict and one may be more significant than the other, in which case the network is at the mercy of the processing order. Therefore, it is important for the ascending order of acls to reflex the precedence of rules that may conflict or overlap.

- I don't understand where these acls are deployed, of course that is relative to what the rules target, the type of acl. But are they configured for each port or for an entire network device.



- doesn't the frequency with which these stp packets are sent increase the vulnerability scope of the network with regard to packet poisoning attacks. Secondly, can stp be configured manually such that configuration packets are not sent after deployment. So that all the configurations are added and managed statically. Is that solution feasible as a means to increase the security of small to mid-sized networks.
- are all packet sniffers inactive? how about an active packet sniffer that can run switching software and poison stp packets to elect itself as a root bridge? Is that possibe?
 keep in mind that disabled ports are not disabled by stp but are down physically, Therefore, activating the port implies a topology change and therefore the spanning tree is recalculated, and that is how the port goes through the other states.

- the root port is optimal as a path to the root bridge but was is it used for, is it used to foward user traffic which must go through the root bridge first, in accordance with the loop-free tree. It also receives comfiguration BPDUs

- how does a switch know how many configuration BPDUs to send and how does the network determine when to stop sending these packets, that is, does this happen when each and every bridge has received BPDUS from all bridges on the network and, and therefore each and every bridge has received the optimal BPDU and the root bridge has been elected.

remember how packet filtering was used to protect dns root servers from an icmp ddos attack.
- learn about the fiber distributed digital interface network
- what is a heartbeat link
- tommorow configure eth-trunk on packet tracer

- can a vlan be used as a parameter for load balancing
this protocol is quite involved. An active interface on one end must correspond to the interface that the link connects to on the other end. So how does the elective process work? When one interface is actived, does that mean the correspondent interface on the other end is inadvertently activated? In short, are interfaces treated in pairs in this protocol? That's actually the case. and the elective process is done on one end, the actor device, and then duplicated by the surbodinate node.

- is istack and eth-trunk limited to huwaei devices
Analysis

-I have discovered a few interesting protocols through this module and each has an interesting feature. What sets LACP apart is that it can perform configurations on one node and send them to the other for duplication. Of course, the mechanism suits the scope. but are there other contexts that may require a similar protocol design. 

the module says the number of required router interfaces depends on the quantity of vlans, which was the case in our cisco example, but that's because we created logical interfaces on the router. The module also says the interface of the switch connecting to the router must be the access type, by in our cisco example it was a trunk interface. oh so the module regonises this as one method

 now that I know the meaning of these flags, the tcn process makes a lot more sense.
if the root bridge is constantly sending packets every 2s, that seems like it will cause a broadcast radiation. However these BPDUs are only sent to switches, so that's reasonable. how do we have pid appeearing twice in the same bpdu. maybe it's why its set to 0

- so protocols which implement elective packets have a higher vulnerability scope in relation to main-in-the-middle attacks. And most elective protocols always seek to identify superior nodes, to which superior rights will be assigned. This, in theory, makes it easy for an attacker to poison the elective process and elect themselves as a superior node, thereby gaining priveledge to a network's resources. So, that's one natural drawback, in my opinion, in relation to elective protocols.

- Istack is a perfect techonology because if you combine aggregate links, you can treat them as one instead of figuring out which one to block and what not, and this design lessens convergence issues.`

- i don't know how layer 3 switches work, but wouldn't it be more interesting if we had one device that can change from switching mode to router mode, and had ports for both functions, such that if you wanted to use it for switching, you can enter the mode and turn on the relevant ports, or vice versa. or what if we had a set of ports that were bluetooth active, then you can connect to them, connect to them through your pc and run the relevant software for switching or routing.

my invention is simple, have a set of ports that can be connected to via bluetooth or wifi. Then the switching or routing software will be accessed through some application in the user's terminal. With that design, the admin will have an interface running in his computer that allows him to configure these sets of ports from his pc. For example, instead of deploying access switches, deploy a group of ports where access switches are required. Connect to this group of ports wirelessly and manage them through an interface on your pc. One inherent advantage of this is scalability, you don't have to buy an entire network device every time you need to expand the network or increase the number of ports. You just buy a few ports, held together by an appropriate tower, connect to them wirelessly and manage them through your terminal. One downside is the reliability and security of the wireless connections to these ports and the effect on the network, however, this is something that can be handled easily. One main attraction is that this design is more cost effective. another possible issue is that the admin's terminal must always be on, there'll also be one spof for the entire network, but that seems like something that can be navigated, admitedly, this is a design suitable to small networks. lastly, one redundant addition is to add ai to the software used as an assistant of the network admin.

- Imagine a circuit-switching network that implements link aggregation. Imagine the forwading bandwith that can be utilised in an instance.

- this is what I thought of on my musings about ospf with respect to devices.So having more than one switch and forming an aggregate switch through them logically can minise ospf at whatever layer of deployment. So ospf also depends on the level of the device in the topology's hierarchy. I also wondered about the neccesity of having dual-homed devices, but it's now self-evident

- It's a nice protocol for implementing link load balancing, which is a concept new to me. I always thought of load balancing in relation to servers. With enough resources, vbst allows us to implement an entire path limited to just one VLAN, that represents an institutions main service, instead of using QOS policies to arrive at a similar result. That path will be configured as a tree for the critical vlan on the network using vbst.

- this rpc comparison when computing a designated port seems quite confusing, the rpc is the cost to the root bridge, so how can ports of a root bridge compare rpcs? unless these are the rpcs of the configuration ports they have received. designated ports are also calculated for non-root bridges, remeber that 

- are these stp processes done sequentially, it would be chaotic if they happened otherwise. Imagine a switch considering itself a non-root bridge and blocking some of it's ports to a neighbouring switch before the neighbour has sent its configuration BPDU that might influence the switch to reconsider the network topology.

- the module is a bit weird, sending is implicatively distinguished from receiving as an instance by which an interface receives a frame from another. it also gives an exaplantion for when an interface receives a tagged frame, while frame receiving seems to be an instance when the interface received the frame from a terminal incapable of vlan encapsulation. Thereore, it is illogical and absurd to explain what happens when an interface receives a tagged frame, as it cannot based on the above assumptions.

- stp is used to tackle SPOF in relation to links by using duplication. However, the domain of spof in computer networks extends beyond links. Therefore, what are other critical-components in networking  that implement a mechanism to counter spof, either through a protocol or some design considerations. For example, I would implement a software-based mechanism by which various access switches are all grouped together virtually, so that if one switch fails, the devices under it can still maintain a connection through the virtual access switch. Of course, there must be a procotol that constantly checks the down or up status of a switch, and when a switch is discovered to be down through some packets, it will merely act as a bridge through which traffic is sent to the other active switches. But this is an enormously radical solution, and so will it's ports, firmware, and connections be. But it is a very cost-effective system and minises the impact of spof in relation to switches.

the paradox of using mac addresses to improve network security is that this makes the network liable to an adress spoofing attack, which is the easiest attack against a network.

questions
`
- I have never tried out broadcast or multicast frames on packet tracer, should also do that. can we ping using broadcast packets?
- do gateways process broadcast frames?
- how to implement inter-vlan broadcast frames? or is this done through vlan 1, which includes all intefaces, when switches have a direct connection, what happens when the switch broadcast the packets to the other switch, does the receiving switch also boriadcast the packet or does it's interface terminate it?
- is it possible for spanning trees to be calculated based on sub interfaces?
- what about an inverse of a layer 3 switch?
- like a layer 2 router, have logical swich ports, the main module is the routing module, and it can pass packets corresponding to a logical interface for further processing.
- can I assume that all entries to a vlanif table will always be direct?
- is smart link the only protocol for dual-homed devices? If we use smart link for the bandwidth utilisation of multiple links, can istack be used to utilise the processing power of all the switches in the aggregate switch, or is that actually how it works?
- which is better, one link with x bandwidth, or an aggregate link amounting to x bandwidth. The latter provides links for more connections and you can just aggregate them for one instance. However, the number of links is also affected by the available ports.

- is there an iStack-like system for routers. It will be easier to manages routers in one lan as a logical unit.
- can one vlan use more than one mstpI, as a method for further load balancing oh, they can.
- but how does vbst reduce configuration costs when you have to configures trees for each and every VLAN.

- can we assign a password to a port, does rstp or any protocol do that, that's one way to keep the network safe from within.

- if rstp only improved on stp by shortening timeout intervals, that will be redundant because you can reconfigure a bpdu's time interval.

- but stp also assigns a new root port when one fails, even though its procedure might be redundant as it assumes it to be a root bridge failure. so maybe rstp optimises this.

- but yesterday I asked if these broadcast packets were sent to all devices.

what if i set the bridge priority of 2 switches as 0, which one is going to be the root bridge, presumming I haven't run the root bridge command.

- it is senseless how trunk interfaces tag frames and still check if the vid is permitted, why wouldn't a trunk interface permit its own vlan frames?
- is the role of ports determined for the root bridge only.
- what constitutes a topology change and triggers tcn packets. can an interface's turning on or off trigger TCNs.
- what if the interface through which a switch must send a frame is down, does it send an icmp message?

- makes some time to study QOS implementation.
- what is cfi

- what is the correlation of the shortest path calculations for spf and ospf.

so write the test for the first networks course on the weekend

- this module would have been more informative if it explained the use of vlans in qos management, like in bandwidth priortisation


from the figure in the module, how is the first switch able to idetify the frames VLAN? Remeber, the vlans are cofigured on the access switches as opposed to terminals.

- in the process of establishing adjacency, page 25 in the huawei module, what will be the subsequent packets if R1 discovers that it is the master?

without the ability to group devices logically, all related devices will have to be confined to the same geography. But that raised an interesting question? Is a VLAN limited to one subnet, or can there be cross-subnet VLANs?

- Mac address based VLAN assignment is not responsive to network topology changes, specifically when devices have to be added and removed from the network. interface based assigment is better since removing the switch also removes the VLAN configurations. Ip based assignment is preferable if each subnet represents a department and you want to limit cross-department communication.

- what if you have to send a broadcast frame to an entire network segmented by VLANs?

- what is the VID

- the difference between the switch receiving and sending a frame is quite confusing, cause a switch typically perfoms both at once. But, the module separates sending as an instance when the the interface receives a frame from another interface. The module doesn't specify what happens when the frame received is untagged under sending, but if the switch is running VLAN, then an interface cannot send another interface an untagged frame.

- but the mac address based method is useful when assigned to network devices, since they hold the network configurations and removing them means reconfiguring.

- since mac addresses identify interfaces, what happens of you add the mac address of a switch's interface as the destination address, does the sqitch discard the packet.

- what is ppp?
- what are frame relays?
- what isn't there a protocol designed for point to multipoint acess, could be interesting.
- what is the gr state of an interface?
- define non-preemption?
difference between a backbone router and an ABR
- can two or more ports belong to the same nic
- when the author says this determines how far the destination is, does this answer my main question about how routers are computed.
- since two routers share a link, what ip address will be stored as? Oh, the interface name is what it stores?
- does spf consider bandwidth over hop count
- how does an ospf area differ from other logical groups like VLANs besides the layer. In short, why should devices be grouped in areas in ospf, or do they represent subnets, i'm confused. Oh,has to do with gateways
- how does an ospf routing table differ from an ip table. The only difference is that the protocol field is replaced by the type field, which makes sense since one protocol is running in this context. and the type propably (not sure) identifies the route's capacitym full-duplex or what not, really not sure

to-dos
- look up path vector algorithms
- implement an algorithm to do route summarization calculations.


i'm still a lil confused about designated ports, AI can help
- this concept of STP is by far the second most interesting concept after Ethernet table learning.

- So on a layer 2 broadcast domain, a bus topology is implied? And do they use a flooding mechanism?
then tracert is ping merely incrementing the TTL?
- Why do we need an entire protocol to fix a looping problem that is solved using one PDU property?

we begin at page 124 to 222

so did Ethernet hubs use circuit-switching

We will cover network protocols and IP address and IP routing basics

 questioning approach.

Check out past papers.

do another course on network that uses cmd and another network simulator while you figure out how to simulate vrp
flags field in ip table

- look up meth management and GE service interfaces



questions
- is it neccessary to create an auxiliary protocolo for ethernet. If not, what are the mechanism implemented at the data link layer to transmit error and control messages.


- how are exterior routes learned, it seems as though a dynamoc protocol is the only option we have?
- when you configure a static route, does that mean you are responsiblity for specifying its cost?
- how is hop by hop  forwarding implemented? seems weird. Does the router learn of the route to the destination subnet and feeds that info to all intermediate routers. How will the router know the next hop has an entry for toward the destination to avoid packet loss? Especialy in the context of tcp.
- was a lil confused about how route summarisation is implement. The agregate address is less specific, but still points to the overall network and decapsulation is possible since packets have a destination field
- are floating routes used to implement load balancing?

The efficiency of the ip table's searching algorithm can be improved by grouping routes with the same next-hop address, or outbound interface

Absolutely — MPLS really shines in traffic engineering, and that's one of its biggest advantages over traditional IP routing.

---

### 🚦What Is Traffic Engineering?

Traffic engineering is the process of optimizing the flow of data through a network to improve performance, reliability, and utilization. Think of it as managing digital traffic to avoid congestion, reduce latency, and prioritize critical services — much like urban planners design road systems to prevent bottlenecks.

---

### 🧭 How MPLS Enables Traffic Engineering

MPLS allows for explicit routing decisions, meaning you can define precise paths that traffic should take — even if those paths differ from the shortest or most conventional ones.

Here's how it works:

- **Label-Switched Paths (LSPs):** MPLS uses LSPs to predefine routes through the network. These aren’t dynamically recalculated like in traditional IP — they're explicitly set by network admins or software controllers.
- **Constraint-Based Routing:** LSPs can be created based on constraints like bandwidth availability, latency requirements, or even link reliability. This lets administrators shape traffic proactively.
- **Resource Reservation Protocol – Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE):** This protocol helps set up LSPs that satisfy certain constraints. It checks if the network can support a path that meets your traffic needs and reserves resources accordingly.
- **Fast Reroute (FRR):** MPLS supports rapid failover by pre-calculating backup paths. If something breaks, the switch to the backup path is nearly instantaneous.

---

### 📊 Real-World Benefits of MPLS in Traffic Engineering

| Benefit                    | MPLS Contribution                                                |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Congestion Avoidance      | Routes traffic over less congested paths                         |
| SLA Compliance            | Ensures traffic meets service level agreements (latency, uptime) |
| Bandwidth Optimization    | Allocates network resources efficiently                          |
| Fault Tolerance           | Enables fast failover and redundancy                             |
| Prioritized Services      | Supports quality of service (QoS) for VoIP, video, etc.          |

---

💡 If you're curious about integrating this into a system, you might like exploring how RSVP-TE works alongside OSPF-TE or IS-IS-TE as the IGPs that carry topology and link-state information. It’s the perfect playground for applying structured logic to routing decisions.


since MPLS is connection oriented, that implies that data forwarding is not hop to hoop


You're touching on a subtle but important distinction. MPLS is indeed considered connection-oriented, but it doesn't bypass hops entirely—it just treats them differently compared to traditional IP routing. Here's the breakdown:

### 🚧 How MPLS Data Forwarding Works
- **Label Switched Path (LSP):** When a packet enters the MPLS network, it's assigned a label based on its Forwarding Equivalence Class (FEC). This label maps out a predetermined path through the network—a Label Switched Path.
- **Per-Hop Forwarding with Labels:** While the packet still moves hop-by-hop, each router (known as a Label Switch Router or LSR) forwards the packet based on its label rather than performing a complex route lookup. So yes, it's hop-by-hop, but it's much faster and more deterministic.

### 📬 MPLS vs IP Routing
| Feature               | MPLS                          | IP Routing                      |
|----------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Path Setup           | Predefined LSP (connection-oriented) | Dynamic based on routing tables |
| Forwarding Decision  | Based on label                | Based on destination IP         |
| Performance          | High (due to fast lookup)     | Lower (more processing needed)  |
| Scalability          | More scalable via Traffic Engineering | Less efficient in large networks|

### 🔎 The “Connection-Oriented” Nuance
- MPLS sets up a logical connection (LSP) beforehand—like a virtual circuit.
- Each hop still forwards the packet, but only by swapping labels based on the LSP.
- So it’s **not** connectionless like IP, but it's **not** connection-oriented in the same way as traditional circuits either (e.g., ATM or Frame Relay).

It's like riding a train: the path and stations are decided before the journey starts, but you still stop at each station—the train just knows exactly where to go.

Would you like to look into how MPLS supports traffic engineering or VPNs next? Those add another layer of utility to this clever routing approach.


capwap tunnels are udp based, is this sound for service traffic


Great question — CAPWAP's use of UDP definitely invites scrutiny when it comes to transporting service-critical traffic like voice or real-time video.

---

### 📡 What Is CAPWAP?

CAPWAP (Control And Provisioning of Wireless Access Points) is a protocol used to manage communication between wireless access points (APs) and wireless LAN controllers (WLCs). It splits traffic into two planes:
- **Control Messages**: For managing the AP (setup, configuration, etc.)
- **Data Messages**: For forwarding client traffic

Both are encapsulated in UDP — control typically on port 5246, and data on 5247.

---


### ⚠️ Implications of Using UDP

UDP is:
- **Connectionless**: No handshake, no guaranteed delivery.
- **Fast & Lightweight**: But vulnerable to loss and jitter.
  
That sounds risky, right? But here’s why it works:

### ✅ Why CAPWAP Over UDP Is Acceptable for Service Traffic

- **Designed for Reliability**: CAPWAP compensates for UDP’s lack of delivery guarantees by implementing its own retry logic and fragmentation handling at the application layer.
- **Lower Overhead**: Unlike TCP, there's no congestion control or retransmission delay, which benefits real-time applications.
- **Centralized Control**: The controller manages QoS and can prioritize real-time traffic (like VoIP) through CAPWAP tunnels.
- **Segregated Tunnels**: CAPWAP data traffic is separated from control, preventing config chatter from interfering with services.

---

### 🧪 Real-World Considerations

| Factor                | CAPWAP Impact                                   |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| VoIP / Real-Time QoS | Acceptable if QoS is enforced at controller/AP   |
| Packet Loss          | Managed by application-level retransmission logic |
| Latency Sensitivity  | Lowered by avoiding TCP overhead                 |
| Network Congestion   | Requires proper prioritization/QoS configuration |

---

In short: **CAPWAP’s UDP encapsulation is sound _if_ the WLAN infrastructure is properly engineered** — with low-latency links, traffic shaping, and intelligent retry policies.

If you're designing or auditing such networks, inspecting how CAPWAP tunnels interact with DSCP markings and QoS policy might be a next interesting step.

CHAP alternatives

CHAP was a clever early solution, but its limitations — like reliance on MD5 and lack of mutual authentication — pushed the industry toward stronger protocols like MS-CHAPv2 and EAP-TLS. Here’s how they step up the security game:

---

### 🔒 MS-CHAPv2 (Microsoft Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol Version 2)

A direct upgrade to CHAP, tailored for Microsoft environments and used with VPNs and PPP connections.

#### 🔧 Key Improvements:
- **Mutual Authentication**: Both client and server verify each other. CHAP only authenticates the client.
- **Stronger Hashing**: Uses SHA-1-derived algorithms instead of MD5 (though it's still not ideal today).
- **Challenge-Response With Session Keys**: The response includes encryption of a challenge using session keys derived from the user’s password, improving confidentiality.

#### 🧪 Weaknesses:
- Still vulnerable if passwords are weak or NTLM hashes are exposed.
- Susceptible to brute-force attacks and dictionary tools like *asleap* or *John the Ripper* if intercepted.

---

### 🧬 EAP-TLS (Extensible Authentication Protocol – Transport Layer Security)

Considered one of the **most secure** authentication protocols in modern wireless and enterprise environments.

#### 🛡️ Why It’s Better:
- **Certificate-Based Authentication**: No passwords needed. Each client and server uses X.509 certificates.
- **Mutual Authentication**: Bulletproof identity verification on both sides.
- **Encrypted Tunnel**: All authentication exchanges occur within a secure TLS tunnel.
- **Perfect Forward Secrecy**: Even if a key is compromised, past sessions remain protected.

#### 🚀 Typical Use Cases:
- WPA2/WPA3-Enterprise wireless networks.
- VPNs that require high security.
- Identity management with RADIUS servers.

If you’re working on secure communication systems or encoding frameworks, EAP-TLS offers a gold-standard template for designing robust authentication layers. Want to dive into how EAP chaining or certificate validation logic works next? I can sketch out a flow for that.

What is the NAT mode or protocol used by ISPs?

ISPS use carrier-grade NAT, which is a PAT protocol that allows multiple costumers to use the same public address. Sounds like easy ip

NAT Server is just static NAt on an internal server that is publicly accessible.

EASY IP and NAPT are the same, they only differ in that easy IP is easy to configure.

So if a device in our NAT configs doesn't have a mapping to a public address, does that imply that it is inaccessible to the internet.

Yes, the device is inaccesible as there's no public address to use to route data to it. So if you want to enhance the security of an FTP server, don't give it a public address. Apparently, the server can still be accessed through the company's VPN.



















for my second project, I should implement all these technologies, of course the requirements can be tweaked slightly:
- ipv4 dhcp through server
- ipv6 SLAAC and dhcp on router
- vlan inter-VLAN through subintefaces
- prevent vlan hoping
- WLAN technologies
- for this project, design a wired-centric network, therefore requiring a fat architecture, or just do both architecture
- some aps should be independent, others should be done through a wlan controller, for now, configure service traffic to tape a path different for control packets meant for the wlan controller. you can make the wlan controller, specifying ap groups so i can give guest aps and staff aps
- add nat, PAT preferably
- ssh and snmp
- for routing, use on of these protocols, ospf, rip, bgp, or eidrp, but since this network is a wan, do more than one for different lans
- also add ntp
- web, dns, and email servers
- subnetting
- aaa, radius and tacas
- acl and firewall
- eth trunk
- IPv6 anycast address for distributed servers


- do networking
- finish cisco
- do engish
- finalise chs
- do SAD




You're tapping into a really compelling shift in how SPOF (Single Point of Failure) mitigation can evolve with NFV (Network Functions Virtualization). Let’s break down and refine your idea into a structured argument that could be used in a design proposal or technical justification:

---

## 🧠 Rethinking SPOF Mitigation with NFV

### ⚠️ Traditional Approach: Physical Redundancy
- **Cost-heavy**: Requires purchasing and maintaining additional hardware.
- **Slow recovery**: Lead times for replacement gear (e.g., edge routers) can be days or weeks.
- **Static scalability**: Physical nodes are fixed in capacity and location.

### 🌐 NFV as a Dynamic Backup Strategy
- **Rapid deployment**: Virtual routers or firewalls can be spun up in minutes on NFVI (Network Function Virtualization Infrastructure).
- **Cost-efficient**: One centralized NFVI can serve multiple roles, reducing the need for idle standby hardware.
- **Flexible failover**: NFV allows rerouting or instantiating services dynamically based on failure points.

### 🔐 Security Implications
- **DDoS resilience**: NFVI can isolate and absorb traffic surges better than physical nodes, especially if backed by elastic cloud resources.
- **SPOF hardening**: Virtual nodes can be geo-distributed, reducing the risk of localized outages or targeted attacks.

### 💡 Strategic Recommendation
Instead of budgeting for multiple physical standby nodes:
- Maintain a **single NFVI pool** with pre-configured templates for critical functions (e.g., edge routing, firewalling).
- Use **orchestration tools** (like OpenStack or Kubernetes with CNFs) to automate failover and scaling.
- Integrate **monitoring and alerting** to trigger virtual replacements instantly upon failure detection.

as i was saying, i have a concept i call the vulnerability scope, one of its tenets is that centralisation can create easily spof or even network insecurity, but lets consider the network security aspect of it for now, i an sdn centralised control, then hacking into the sdn makes it easy to control the network, since all configs are modifiable from this single point
