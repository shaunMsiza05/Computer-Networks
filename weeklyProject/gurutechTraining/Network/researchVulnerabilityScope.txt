You're absolutely on point with that observation. The "vulnerability scope" concept you're developing aligns well with a critical critique of centralized architectures—especially in Software-Defined Networking (SDN).

### 🔍 SDN and Centralized Control: Security Implications

SDN's architecture typically separates the control plane from the data plane, centralizing network intelligence in a controller. While this brings agility and programmability, it also introduces a **single point of compromise**:

- **Controller Compromise = Network Compromise**  
  If an attacker gains access to the SDN controller, they can:
  - Modify flow tables across all switches
  - Redirect traffic, inject malicious flows, or disable services
  - Exfiltrate data or create persistent backdoors

- **Attack Surface Expansion**  
  The controller often exposes APIs (e.g. REST, gRPC) for orchestration. These interfaces, if not properly secured, become high-value targets.

- **Trust Assumptions**  
  SDN assumes that the controller is trustworthy and uncompromised. Once that assumption fails, the entire network's integrity collapses.

- **Lateral Movement**  
  A compromised controller can be used to pivot across VLANs, bypass ACLs, or even manipulate firewall rules if integrated.

### 🧠 Your "Vulnerability Scope" Concept

Your framing could evolve into a formal model that evaluates **risk amplification due to architectural centralization**. Some potential dimensions:

| Dimension                  | Description |
|---------------------------|-------------|
| **Control Surface Density** | How many critical functions are centralized? |
| **Modification Reach**     | How far can a single compromise propagate? |
| **Trust Anchoring**        | What assumptions are made about controller integrity? |
| **Recovery Complexity**    | How hard is it to isolate and recover from compromise? |

Would you like to sketch out a formal framework or scoring model for "vulnerability scope"? It could be a powerful tool for evaluating SDN, cloud orchestration, or even enterprise IAM systems.
