Introdution
- replaces rfc 760
- as a protocol designed for catenets (concatenated networks) - interconnected systems of packet-switched computer communication networks
- datagrams
- fixed length addresses
- fragmentation and reassembly
- limitation in terms of services like reliability, flow control, sequencing, reserved for host-to-host protocols
- use of local network protocols for hop to hop transmission
- an example of the above with tcp modules passing pseudo headers carrying ip information

Operations
- two main functions: addressing and fragmentation
- fields used for fragmentation
- internet modules in both hosts and gateways
- four main fields for the protocol's services: time to live, type of service. options, and header checksum.
- the type of service is used to indicate the quality of service desired and affects the actual transmission parameters for a network, network used for the next hop, and the next gateway.
- time to live as a self destruct time limit
- the use of the Options field for control functions such as timestamps, security, or special routing
- header checksum for header information intergrity
- use of icmp as a supplement to the protocol for functions like error detection
- the internet protocol interfaces with host-to-host protocols on one end and local network protocols on the other.
- importance of addresses in moving datagrams between internet modules

Addressing
- three main parameters for communication: names, addresses, and routes
- higher level protocols handle mapping between names and addresses, internet modules handle the mapping of internet addresses to local net addresses, then lastly, the lower level protocols handle mapping local addresses to routes.
- format as 4 octes in dotted decimal notation
- classes of addresses: class A (1 bit set to zero as the high order bit, 7 bits for the network number, and the last 24 for the local address. Class B (2 bits for the high order bits, set to 10. 14 bits for the network number and 16 bits for the local address). Class C (three bits for the high order bit set to 100.  21 bits for the network address and 8 bits for the local address).
- enabling the use of several physical interfaces on a single host (multi homing)
- enabling the use of distinct internet addresses to identify a single host.

Fragmentation
- as a procedure used when packet size of datagrams exceed MTUs of networks
- setting don't fragment on to restrict this
- use of fragmentation in private networks
- fields used in fragmentation and their uses:
    identification field: used to ensure fragments are not mixed up during reassembly
    fragment offset - the relative position of the fragment in the original datagram
    more fragments field - reset when carrying the last fragment
- the fragment offset and more fragments being set to zero for complete datagrams
- replicating the header of the datagram across the fragments and the ability to derive fragments of a random number
- the total length of each fragment set as the length of the fragment payload

Reassembly
- four fields used to bind fragments: source and destination adresses, protocol, and identification.
- the first fragment's offset set to zero, and the more fragments of the last fragment set to zero.
- use of the fragment offset values to combine payloads



Questions
- what use case neccessitates enforcing don't fragment?
- what are the traffic distinctions between pre-fragment and post-fragment internet
?
- is an identification field set for complete datagrams?

first rfc I have studied directly, amazing info on the motivation of the protocols and the concepts on which it depends (for rfcs in general), for example, cotenet as the aim of this rfc.
