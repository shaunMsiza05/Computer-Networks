Network Infrastructure Design & Implementation Report
Company: JbSolutions
Prepared By: [Your Name]
Date: [Insert Date]
1️⃣ Executive Summary
This report outlines the design, configuration, and validation of JbSolutions’ enterprise LAN and WAN infrastructure across Office A, Office B, and the Data Center, with emphasis on security, scalability, and availability. Packet Tracer was used to simulate network behavior, enforce ACLs, and validate end-to-end connectivity and segmentation.

2️⃣ Network Architecture Overview
🏢 Office A
Subnet: 192.168.1.0/24

VLANs: HR (VLAN 10), Customer Service (VLAN 20), R&D (VLAN 30), Marketing (VLAN 40)

Devices: Email Server (192.168.1.100), Router, 4 Switches

Services: Telnet, DNS Client, Email

🏢 Office B
Subnet: 192.168.4.0/24

VLANs: Finance (VLAN 50), Sales (VLAN 60), IT (VLAN 70), Operations (VLAN 80)

Devices: Email Server (192.168.4.100), DNS Server, Router, 4 Switches

Services: Telnet, DNS Server, Email

🧠 Data Center
Subnet: 192.168.7.0/24

Devices: Web Servers (192.168.7.150–152), Email Server (192.168.7.100), DNS Authoritative Server (192.168.7.10), Router, 4 Switches

Services: Web, DNS Auth,Telnet

3️⃣ Subnet Calculations
🧮 Office A — 192.168.1.0/25
Section	Gateway	Range	Broadcast
A	192.168.1.1	192.168.1.2 – 192.168.1.126	192.168.1.127
B	192.168.1.129	192.168.1.130 – .254	192.168.1.255
🧮 Office B — 192.168.4.0/25
Section	Gateway	Range	Broadcast
A	192.168.4.1	192.168.4.2 – 192.168.4.126	192.168.4.127
B	192.168.4.129	192.168.4.130 – .254	192.168.4.255
4️⃣ ACL Configuration Summary
🚫 INBOUND-ICMP ACL
Blocks ICMP traffic to critical servers from external sources:

plaintext
5  deny icmp any host 192.168.1.100 
10 deny icmp any host 192.168.1.200
...
45 deny icmp any host 192.168.7.200
50 permit ip any any

🔐 Telnet Access ACL
Restricts Telnet (TCP 23) access to authorized admin hosts only.

5️⃣ DNS Load Balancing Simulation
Intranet devices use Office B’s DNS — resolves jbsolutions.com to internal server.

External access points to Data Center DNS — routes traffic to external web servers.

Priority ordering of A records substitutes true round-robin logic.

6️⃣ Email Server Configuration
Domain: jbsolutions.com

Alias mapping via DNS A records

30 employee accounts split evenly across Office A and B

7️⃣ FTP Access Rules
FTP structure includes /software, /documentation, /marketing, /resources

Only William (Admin, DC subnet) has write access

Other users can read and submit uploads via email

8️⃣ Telnet Access Design
Access policies set per location:

Location	Devices	Admin Access Protocols
Office A	Router, Email Server, Web Server, 4 Switches	Telnet via Router
Office B	Router, Email Server, DNS Server, 4 Switches	Telnet via Router
Data Center	Router, Email Server, Web Server, 4 Switches	Telnet via Router
9️⃣ VLAN Access Control & Segmentation
Office	Floor	Department 1	VLAN	Department 2	VLAN
A	1	HR	10	Customer	20
A	2	R&D	30	Marketing	40
B	1	Finance	50	Sales	60
B	2	IT	70	Operations	80
Inter-VLAN routing is disabled. ACLs optionally reinforce segmentation.

🔍 Testing Summary
✔️ ACL Verification
Test ID	Source → Destination	Protocol	Expected Outcome
TC01	Ext → 192.168.1.100	ICMP	Blocked
TC02	Int → DNS/Web Server	IP	Permitted
✔️ VLAN Isolation
Test ID	VLAN A → B	Result
TC09	HR → Customer Service	Denied
TC10	R&D → Marketing	Denied
✔️ Telnet
Test ID	Device	Origin	Expected Result
TC15	Office A Router	Admin Device	Allowed
TC16	Office B Email Server	Non-Admin	Denied
✅ Conclusion
The project delivers a robust, simulation-ready infrastructure for JbSolutions, complete with subnet planning, VLAN isolation, ACL enforcement, DNS-based web redirection, secured Telnet access, and service redundancy. Further enhancements may include dynamic routing protocols, traffic logging, and ACL optimization.
