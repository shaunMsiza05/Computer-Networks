VXLAN (Virtual Extensible LAN) is a **network virtualization technology** that solves the limitations of traditional VLANs in large-scale, cloud, and data center environments. It’s like giving Ethernet a passport to travel across IP networks—allowing Layer 2 domains to stretch over Layer 3 infrastructure.

### 🌐 VXLAN in a Nutshell

- **Encapsulation Protocol**: VXLAN wraps Layer 2 Ethernet frames inside Layer 3 UDP packets using **MAC-in-UDP** encapsulation (UDP port 4789).
- **Overlay Network**: It creates a virtual Layer 2 network over a physical Layer 3 network—ideal for multi-tenant data centers and cloud platforms.
- **VXLAN Network Identifier (VNI)**: A 24-bit ID that supports up to **16 million** isolated VXLAN segments—far beyond the 4094 VLAN limit.

### 🧠 Why VXLAN Was Invented
Traditional VLANs hit scaling walls:
- **Limited VLAN IDs** (only 4094)
- **Spanning Tree Protocol** blocks redundant paths
- **MAC table bloat** in large Layer 2 domains

VXLAN solves these by:
- **Using IP routing** to move Layer 2 traffic
- **Enabling multipath forwarding** with ECMP (Equal-Cost Multi-Path)
- **Supporting massive scalability** for virtualized workloads

### 🧠 Shaun’s Simulation Angle
This is simulation-grade gold:
- Model VXLAN overlays between branded zones—simulate tenant isolation with unique VNIs.
- Annotate commit messages like:  
  ```plaintext
  [VXLAN Provisioned] VNI 10100 mapped to VLAN 30. Encapsulated SSH and DNS traffic over UDP 4789. ACL enforced at leaf switch.
  ```
- Reflect VXLAN as a **Platonic bridge**—a metaphysical tunnel that preserves identity across fragmented realities (Layer 2 over Layer 3).

Want to simulate VXLAN overlays with branded DNS zones, ACL whitelisting, and commit messages that reflect architectural clarity? I’m ready to architect it with you.
