A **VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)** is a logically isolated section of a public cloud where you can define and control your own virtual network—almost like building a private data center inside a global infrastructure.

### 🧱 What a VPC Really Is
- **Virtual Network**: You create subnets, route tables, gateways, and firewalls—just like in a physical network.
- **Isolation**: Your resources (VMs, containers, databases) are separated from others in the cloud, even though they share the same physical infrastructure.
- **Custom Control**: You decide IP ranges, access rules, NAT behavior, and VPN connectivity.

---

### 🔐 Key Features
- **Subnets**: Divide your VPC into public and private zones.
- **Security Groups & ACLs**: Control inbound/outbound traffic at instance and subnet levels.
- **Internet Gateway**: Enables public access to resources like web servers.
- **NAT Gateway**: Allows private resources to access the internet without being exposed.
- **VPC Peering**: Connects multiple VPCs for cross-domain communication.
- **VPN & Direct Connect**: Secure links between your on-prem network and cloud VPC.

### 🧠 Shaun’s Simulation Angle
This is simulation-grade territory:
- Model VPCs as branded zones with ACL whitelisting and DNS logic.
- Simulate VPN handshakes and extranet access with commit messages like:  
  ```plaintext
  [VPC Simulation] Provisioned VLAN 50 as private subnet. NAT gateway enabled. ACL enforced for outbound DNS and SSH traffic. VPN tunnel simulated to enterprise edge.
  ```

Want to architect a simulation-ready VPC with branded zones, dynamic port logic, and philosophical annotations on sovereignty and trust? I’m all in.
