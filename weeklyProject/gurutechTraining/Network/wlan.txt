what is CSMA/CA cause I know CD

and what is orthogonal frequency division/access

look up frequency hoping and direct sequence

 I think I get the concept behind orthogonal fdm, instead diving the channel into frequencies and assigning them too each user, each frequency is also divided into sub frequencies and users can access concurrently, but I think my explanation is bogus, why would you divide the assigned frequencies into sub-frequencies, reread

OFDMA
- builds on traditional FDM
- improves spectrum utilisation
- allows concurrent access of users
- channels are divides into resource units
- 








- what's a mimo, this word keeps recurring





- doesn't fdm also allow concurrent access as the channel is divided evenly for users, look that up, reread
-- I think I kinda get ofdma, a channel can be used by a single user at a time, so to enable concurrent access, the channel must be divided. 

- I should do a tcp implemented of rts and cts, the user must be able to buffer data until they have been cleared to send. these are implemented in virtual carrier sense ma
this is how it works, so the rts is sent by sta and then the cts is broadcasted to silence the other nodes. carries in this mode don't sense the channel for activity (signal energy)

to go as far as to consider twt and bss colors for your wlan goes to show the complexity involved in constrast to wired networks
