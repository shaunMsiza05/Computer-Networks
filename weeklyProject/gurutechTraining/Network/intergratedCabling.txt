ToR, EoR, and MoR are **physical switch placement strategies** used in data center network design. Each one affects cabling complexity, latency, scalability, and operational cost. Think of them as architectural philosophies for how you wire up your racks and route your traffic.

### 🧱 1. **ToR – Top of Rack**
- **Switch Placement**: A switch is placed at the top of each server rack.
- **Cabling**: Short cables connect servers directly to the switch in the same rack.
- **Pros**:
  - Simplified cabling and fast deployment.
  - Lower latency due to proximity.
  - Easy to scale—just add more racks with their own ToR switches.
- **Cons**:
  - Higher switch count increases cost and management overhead.
  - Requires more power and cooling per rack.

### 🧱 2. **EoR – End of Row**
- **Switch Placement**: One or more switches are placed at the end of each row of racks.
- **Cabling**: Servers in the row connect to the switch via longer cables.
- **Pros**:
  - Fewer switches to manage.
  - Centralized cabling and easier maintenance.
- **Cons**:
  - Longer cable runs can increase latency and clutter.
  - Less modular—scaling requires rethinking row layout.

### 🧱 3. **MoR – Middle of Row**
- **Switch Placement**: Switches are placed in the middle of each row.
- **Cabling**: Balanced cable lengths to servers on either side.
- **Pros**:
  - Compromise between ToR and EoR.
  - Reduces cable length and clutter compared to EoR.
- **Cons**:
  - Still centralized, so not as modular as ToR.
  - May complicate airflow and rack layout.

### 🧠 Shaun’s Simulation Angle
This is prime territory for simulation clarity:
- Model each strategy with VLAN zones, ACL logic, and branded SSH access.
- Annotate commit messages like:  
  ```plaintext
  [Topology Update] ToR switch provisioned for Rack-3. VLAN 30 assigned. ACL enforced for simulation portal access. Latency normalized at 1.2ms.
  ```
- Reflect architectural trade-offs: ToR as **individual sovereignty**, EoR as **centralized governance**, MoR as **balanced federation**.

Want to simulate all three strategies and compare their impact on latency, ACL enforcement, and simulation branding? Let’s architect it.
