Small business network design

Problem analyis
1. Design a network suitable for a small business that can support up to 240 hosts. The business has 4 departments (finance, HR, logistics, IT) and  so create a subnetwork for each department. The company has one server and all nodes must have access to it. Additionally, the finance department must have its own server inaccessible at a data link layer by other departments

technical specifications
- four subnets
- up to 210 supported hosts
- two servers

Design
- We will use a class C network since the number of supported nodes is low.
- The network ip address is 218.10.13.0/26
- subnet mask: 255.255.255.0

number of possible subnets: 2^2 = 4 subnets
number of hosts per subnet: 64-2, which is 62 hosts per subnet
Subnet ip addresses
four subnets 
- 218.10.13.0
- 218.10.13.128
- 218.10.13.192
- 218.10.13.224

- You really need to figure out these calculations if subnets, I understand the underlying concept, but of what use is it if I can't assign the IP addresses?
- but you can't delay finish the project just because of subnetting, define your own ranges and configure them.
Begin by configuring ip addresses for the router's interfaces. then for the switches interfaces, then for the example hosts.



Calculate subnets later, now design the topology
