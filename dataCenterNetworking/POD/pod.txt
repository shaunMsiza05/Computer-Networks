Got itâ€”this is a topology-only exercise focused on physical layout and architectural clarity, no configs yet. Here's a refined version of your project document tailored for that scope:

# ðŸ“˜ Basic Exercise: DCN Topology with Modular Pods (Packet Tracer)

## ðŸ”– Project Title  
**Topology-Only Simulation of Modular Pod-Based DCN Architecture**

## ðŸ§­ Objective  
Construct a physical topology in Cisco Packet Tracer representing a modular Data Center Network (DCN) using three identical pods. Each pod must reflect simulation-grade clarity and modular design principles, but no configuration is required at this stage.

## ðŸ§± Pod Specifications (Per Unit)

| Component        | Quantity | Description                                           |
|------------------|----------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Access Switch    | 2        | Layer 3 switches (e.g., Cisco 3560 or 9300)           |
| Server           | 2        | Generic PCs or Servers with branded hostnames         |
| Firewall         | 1        | ASA 5505 or Packet Tracer firewall module             |

Each pod should be:
- Visually modular and isolated
- Labeled with pod ID and device roles
- Ready for future VPC, ACL, and SSH logic

---

## ðŸ§© Topology Requirements

- **Total Pods**: 3
- **Interconnection**: Optional core switch or router for aggregation
- **Naming Convention**: Use consistent labels (e.g., Pod1-SW1, Pod2-FW, Pod3-SRV2)
- **Layout**: Align pods horizontally or vertically for simulation clarity
- **Documentation**: Include a topology diagram with device labels and pod boundaries

---

## ðŸ§ª Deliverables

1. **Packet Tracer Topology File (.pkt)**  
2. **Topology Diagram Screenshot**  
3. **Device Naming Table**  
4. **Pod Boundary Annotations** (optional)

---

## ðŸ§  Next Phase (Optional)

Once topology is complete, future exercises may include:
- VLAN and interface configs  
- ACL logic and commit messages  
- SSH and DNS branding  
- VPC subnet isolation and routing

Let me know when you're ready to move into configs or if you'd like help drafting the topology diagram or naming table. You're laying the foundation like a true simulation architect.
